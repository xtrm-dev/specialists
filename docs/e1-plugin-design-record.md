# Substrate Claude Code plugin — complete design for file-by-file review

Author: Claude session `specialists-xt-claude-plugin-design`
Worktree: `.xtrm/worktrees/specialists-xt-claude-plugin-design`
Scope: operator spec §§A–E, wave E1 (`docs/claude-native-integration-spec-2026-09-09.md`);
PRD §13.1 parity inventory.
Status: APPROVED 2026-09-09 by pi-specialists, with the §3 SCRUTINY fix applied below.
DESIGN ONLY. No repo file written. Bead `unitAI-aiwva.2` is `contract:draft` and
held; no claim taken, so the Edit gate is closed by design, not by accident.

---

## 0. Base precondition (read before anything else)

**SATISFIED 2026-09-10.** `xt/fj3f` reached `master` as squash-merge `2105ad1a`
("Wave E E3+E4: SDK v2 strict MCP server + specialist_resume", PR #313).

Test the precondition by CONTENT, not by commit ancestry. `8e8b0439` and `a201222f` are
NOT ancestors of `origin/master` — the PR squashed them — so an `is-ancestor` gate would
wrongly refuse a valid base. The correct check is:

```sh
git cat-file -e origin/master:src/mcp/v2-server.ts        # v2 server present
git show origin/master:src/mcp/v2-server.ts | grep -q serveStdio
git show origin/master:src/index.ts | grep -q SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER
```

Verified on `xt/fj3f`:
- `src/mcp/v2-server.ts` serves via `serveStdio(() => buildV2Server(), { legacy: 'reject' })`
  against `@modelcontextprotocol/server/stdio`;
- capabilities `{ tools: { listChanged: false } }` — no prompts, no logging (§N, §K);
- per-request protocol metadata read through `PROTOCOL_VERSION_META_KEY` on the request
  envelope (§H);
- seven tools registered: `use_specialist`, `specialist_status`, `specialist_dispatch`,
  `specialist_reply`, `specialist_resume`, `specialist_stop_activation`, `specialist_list`;
- `src/index.ts:1444` — no subcommand starts v2 by default; `SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER=legacy`
  selects the handwritten 2025-era server.

Dispatching E1 against today's base packages the legacy `initialize`-era server behind a
plugin that claims 2026-07-28 conformance. That is the stale-base failure mode; the Git
State Precondition applies.

## 1. Package layout

```text
plugins/substrate/                     ← plugin root == ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
├── .claude-plugin/

├── .mcp.json

```

Seven files, no build step of its own. Shipped by adding `"plugins/substrate/"` to
`package.json` `files`, so an npm install of `@jaggerxtrm/specialists` yields a loadable
plugin directory, and `claude --plugin-dir plugins/substrate` works from the checkout.

NOT shipped in E1, deliberately: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `agents/`, `commands/`,
`workflows/`, `monitors/`, `output-styles/`, `themes/`, `settings.json`, `.lsp.json`.
§A forbids adding components merely because Claude supports them. Monitors and channels are
wave E6, which §AK forbids mixing into E1–E5.

## 2. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — full contents

```json
{
  "name": "substrate",
  "description": "Substrate work authority in Claude Code: specialist activation over MCP, session continuity hooks, and the using-substrate doctrine skill.",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": { "name": "XTRM", "url": "https://github.com/xtrm-dev/specialists" },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/xtrm-dev/specialists#readme",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Six fields. Omissions from the §C field list, each with a reason:

| Omitted | Reason |
|---|---|
| `skills`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `commands`, `agents`, `workflows` | conventional paths (`skills/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`) are auto-discovered; an explicit list is a second source of truth that drifts from the directory |
| `strict` | manifest-level strictness rejects unknown fields at load, creating a runtime failure mode for users on a different Claude build. `claude plugin validate --strict` gives the same signal at authoring time, where it belongs |
| `defaultEnabled` | opt-in install. Do not auto-enable a work-authority surface |
| `userConfig`, `dependencies`, `channels`, `experimental.*` | no operational purpose in E1 |
| `displayName`, `keywords`, `category`, `tags`, `metadata` | marketplace cosmetics; add when a marketplace entry exists |

`name: "substrate"` fixes the skill namespace at `/substrate:using-substrate` (§D).
`version` is the plugin's own and is deliberately NOT pinned to the package version
(`3.21.6`): the plugin shape and the runtime version independently, and the E3 server swap
must not force a plugin version bump.

  Obtain and supervise Substrate work from inside Claude Code: dispatch a specialist
  activation against a ready Bead or an inline 7-section contract, read live activation

  edits. Substrate (~/.xtrm/state.db) is the work authority; MCP is the transport.
version: 0.1

# Using Substrate from Claude Code

## Authority model

Read this first. It governs every tool call below.

- Substrate decides WHAT work exists.
- Claims and leases decide WHO owns it.
- The Journal preserves continuity.
- Provenance records WHAT execution produced.
- MCP is an integration protocol, not work authority.
- No transport event silently modifies an executable Issue contract.

A tool result is evidence, not a decision. A dispatch admission is not a result. A message
body never grants authority.

The canonical store is `~/.xtrm/state.db`. It is overridden only by an explicit operator or
test variable in the environment — never by a value this plugin ships.

## Tool surface

Seven tools. The names are exact.

### specialist_dispatch
Creates an activation. Supply EXACTLY ONE of:
- `bead_id` — an existing READY bead, or
- `contract` — an inline contract: seven sections (PROBLEM, SUCCESS, SCOPE, NON_GOALS,
  CONSTRAINTS, VALIDATION, OUTPUT) plus a SCRUTINY level (LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL).
  Eight required parts. SCRUTINY is the level, never an eighth section.

The readiness gate runs BEFORE anything is created. An inline contract creates its bead
first. Do not dispatch against a `contract:draft` bead — promote it first.

Optional: `title`, `model_override`, `thinking_override`
(`off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`), `requested_by`, `coordinator_session_id`,
`epic_context_depth` (1 walks to the parent epic, 2 also the grand-epic).

**Returns identity and admission only — never a result.** Read the result later from
`specialist_status`. Never substitute a result for an interaction message.

**Overrides fail closed.** `model_override` and `thinking_override` are refused before
session creation when unavailable, and are never silently replaced. Report the refusal;
do not retry with a substitute model.

### specialist_status
Live projection of every activation. Per row: `activation_id`, `specialist`, `bead_id`,
`state`, `access`, `model_override`, `thinking_override`, `thinking_level` (omitted when
unset — never fabricate it), `purpose` (a one-line SCOPE-then-SUCCESS excerpt captured once
at dispatch, omitted when absent), `elapsed_s`, `turn_count` (completed child model turns,
cumulative across resume and retry), `token_usage`, `last_activity_at`, and the
validated `result` object on settled activations only.

Forensic IDs never appear in rows. Token usage is a row budget, never a window-context
percentage.

### specialist_reply
Answers a waiting activation by message ID. An unknown ID is reported, never silently
passed.

### specialist_resume
Resumes a settled or waiting activation in the SAME session with a new prompt. Not a second
dispatch: the `activation_id` is kept and the `attempt_id` advances, so the child keeps its
context and its workspace lease. A disposed activation cannot be resumed.

### specialist_stop_activation
Disposes an activation explicitly. This is the irreversible one. Settled activations stay
resumable until stopped — stopping is a duty, not a cleanup afterthought. There is no
cascade: stop each activation you are done with.

### specialist_list
The specialist registry, one compact line per specialist with a dispatchability verdict per
row. `name` returns one full record; `detail: "full"` returns every field. Read this before
relying on a remembered role name.

### use_specialist (deprecated for contract-gated work)
Runs a specialist synchronously and returns its final output. A `bead_id` that
`specialist_dispatch` would REFUSE — draft, closed, or missing a contract section — still
runs here and returns a `readiness_warning` naming what is missing. That divergence is why
it is deprecated: prefer `specialist_dispatch`.

## Working rules

- Never shell out to the `specialists` CLI from a session that has these tools. The MCP
  path is in-process; spawning `sp` defeats the native host.
- Dispatch admission, then poll `specialist_status`. Do not block waiting for a result.
- Every outcome carries a build-identity line. If it names staleness, say so — the runtime
  was rebuilt after load.
- Stop duty: before ending a session, `specialist_status` and stop what you own.

## Non-goals

This skill is not a scheduler, not a merge path, and not a second doctrine for beads or
git. Merge is manual. Beads and git remain the durable work and integration authority.
For CLI-side workflow, see the `using-specialists` skill; it is not restated here.
```

**Duplication decision (§D).** This file is the single authored source for the MCP/plugin
surface. `config/skills/using-specialists/SKILL.md` stays untouched as the CLI-side skill
and is cross-referenced, not restated. If a generic `/using-substrate` exposure is later
wanted outside the plugin namespace, it is generated or symlinked from this file — never
re-authored. `name:` is explicit because marketplace install directories are versioned
(`substrate@0.1.0/`) and directory-derived naming would break.

## 4. `hooks/hooks.json` — full contents

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bun \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/session-start.mjs\"",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bun \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/precompact.mjs\"",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Two events, each mapping to a stated requirement.

**SessionStart** — injects live activation state plus the authority reminder, so a resumed
session does not reason about stale activations. This is the plugin-owned successor to
`config/hooks/specialists-session-start.mjs`, rewritten to read Substrate rather than scan
`${cwd}/.specialists/jobs`.

**PreCompact** — writes the Journal continuity pointer so that after compaction the session
re-derives authoritative state instead of trusting summary prose. §AK E5 names compaction
lifecycle as an acceptance dimension; the hook must exist to be tested.

NOT shipped in E1: `PostToolUse` (today's `specialists-memory-cache-sync.mjs` is
repo-specific beads/FTS plumbing and stays in `.claude/`, not in a distributable plugin),
`Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse` gates. Policy-hook enforcement is PRD §14 /
`WP-H*` with an off → shadow → warn → enforce rollout, and does not begin life inside a
packaging wave.

### `scripts/session-start.mjs` — content spec

- Reads active activations from the canonical store; honours an explicit
  `XTRM_STATE_DB`/operator override if present in the environment, defaults to
  `~/.xtrm/state.db`. Never derives the DB path from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` or
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`.
- Emits, on stdout, a short context block: the authority reminder (one line), then at most
  N active activation rows (`activation_id`, `specialist`, `state`, `bead_id`,
  `last_activity_at`), then nothing when there are none. No banner when the store is absent.
- Never prints a result body, a prompt body, or a forensic ID.
- Wraps every read in try/catch and **exits 0 on every path**, including a missing store, a
  locked DB, and a malformed row. A plugin hook that can block session start is a support
  incident.

### `scripts/precompact.mjs` — content spec

- Writes the Journal continuity pointer (activation IDs currently owned by this session plus
  the store path) so post-compaction the session re-derives state rather than trusting the
  summary.
- Pointer location is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` when set, else a temp path. It is plugin
  installation state, not project state, and never lands in the user's repo.
- Same discipline: try/catch everywhere, exit 0 always, no bodies, no forensic IDs.

## 5. `.mcp.json` — full contents

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "substrate": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/mcp-server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

**No `env` block.** An earlier draft of mine invented `SPECIALISTS_MCP: "1"`, which the
entrypoint does not read. The real variable is `SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER`, whose default is
v2 strict 2026-07-28 — so shipping any value there could only pin the plugin backwards to
the legacy server. Likewise no `SPECIALISTS_STATE_DB`: §B and §AK E2 require the
`~/.xtrm/state.db` override to be explicit and operator-supplied, which means it comes from
the user's environment, never from a config file we ship.

No argv subcommand: `src/index.ts` starts MCP server mode exactly when no subcommand is
given.

### `scripts/mcp-server.mjs` — full contents

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
// Substrate plugin MCP launcher.
//
// Exists for one reason: the runtime entrypoint is dist/index.js inside the
// @jaggerxtrm/specialists package, whose position relative to CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT differs
// between an npm install and a --plugin-dir checkout. Resolve, then import. No argv:
// the entrypoint starts MCP server mode (SDK v2, strict 2026-07-28) when given no
// subcommand.
import { createRequire } from 'node:module';
import { existsSync } from 'node:fs';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

function resolveRuntime() {
  try {
    return require.resolve('@jaggerxtrm/specialists');
  } catch {
    // In-package layout: plugins/substrate/scripts/ -> ../../../dist/index.js
    const local = fileURLToPath(new URL('../../../dist/index.js', import.meta.url));
    if (existsSync(local)) return local;
  }
  return null;
}

const entry = resolveRuntime();
if (!entry) {
  console.error(
    'substrate plugin: cannot locate the specialists runtime.\n' +
      'Install @jaggerxtrm/specialists, or run the plugin from a built checkout ' +
      '(bun run build) so dist/index.js exists.',
  );
  process.exit(1);
}

await import(entry);
```

Rejected alternative, recorded so it is not re-proposed: `{"command": "npx", "args": ["-y",
"@jaggerxtrm/specialists"]}`. Zero scripts, but it floats the runtime version away from the
installed plugin version and requires network on cold start.

---

## 6. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path discipline (§B)

| Variable | Used for | In this package |
|---|---|---|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | anything the plugin ships | hook commands, MCP launcher, skill assets |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` | user-project state only | repo git state and `.beads/` that hooks READ |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` | plugin-owned persistent data | PreCompact continuity pointer |
| `~/.xtrm/state.db` | canonical Substrate authority | never derived from either of the above |

Forbidden, and enforced mechanically:
- any `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/packages/...` path (the §B named anti-pattern);
- any `process.cwd()` fallback for a plugin-owned asset;
- any relative `./scripts/...` in `hooks.json` or `.mcp.json`.

### Lint test — content spec

One vitest case that reads `plugins/substrate/{hooks/hooks.json,.mcp.json,scripts/*.mjs}`
and asserts:
1. every plugin-owned path is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-rooted;
2. none of the forbidden substrings above appears;
3. `.mcp.json` declares no `env` key (regression guard for the correction in §5).

This is the only part of §B a schema validator cannot check.

---

## 7. Validation plan

Four layers; each catches what the previous cannot.

**L1 — manifest schema.** `claude plugin validate ./plugins/substrate --strict`.
Catches manifest shape, unknown fields, malformed `hooks.json` / `.mcp.json`, missing skill
frontmatter. Gate: exit 0, zero warnings under `--strict`. Runs in CI.

**L2 — path discipline.** The vitest case in §6. Runs in CI.

**L3 — development load.** `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/substrate --debug`, manual,
recorded as bead evidence:
1. `/plugin` lists `substrate` as loaded;
2. `--debug` shows MCP server `substrate` connecting over stdio, and both hooks registered
   with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expanded to a real absolute path;
3. `/substrate:using-substrate` resolves — proving §D namespacing and that the explicit
   `name:` survived;
4. `specialist_list` returns the registry and `specialist_status` returns a well-formed
   (possibly empty) projection — proving the launcher resolved the runtime, not merely that
   a process spawned;
5. the negotiated protocol revision is `2026-07-28` and the discovered tool list has seven
   entries including `specialist_resume`.

**L4 — packaged-install load.** `npm pack`, install the tarball into a scratch repository
outside this checkout, run `claude --debug` there, repeat L3 steps 1–5. §C: a source-level
unit test is not sufficient evidence that the plugin is installable. This is the only layer
that exercises launcher resolution branch 1 and a versioned install directory.

Out of scope for E1 validation: compaction-lifecycle E2E (§AK E5) and any E6 wake/transport
evaluation.

---

## 8. Open items for the reviewer

1. **Landing route.** Bead `unitAI-aiwva.2` is `contract:draft` and held. E1 cannot be
   claimed or written until it is promoted, and it must be sequenced after `xt/fj3f` merges
   (§0). Route is yours to set.
2. **`package.json` `files`.** Adding `"plugins/substrate/"` changes the published tarball.
   Confirm that belongs in E1 rather than in the release bead.
3. **Hook successor policy.** `config/hooks/specialists-session-start.mjs` and the plugin's
   `scripts/session-start.mjs` would both inject context in a repo that has run
   `specialists init`. Decide whether E1 deprecates the former, or whether the plugin hook
   suppresses itself when the repo-local hook is present.

---

## 9. Review outcome — 2026-09-09

Reviewer: `pi-specialists` (owner of `docs/claude-native-integration-spec-2026-09-09.md`).
Verdict: **APPROVED** with one blocking fix, now applied.

### Blocking fix (applied in §3)

The SKILL.md draft listed SCRUTINY as both a contract section and the level, naming eight
items as seven sections. Corrected to: seven sections — PROBLEM, SUCCESS, SCOPE, NON_GOALS,
CONSTRAINTS, VALIDATION, OUTPUT — plus a SCRUTINY level; eight required parts.

Verified independently against `xt/fj3f:src/activation/bead-gate.ts:22`: `REQUIRED_SECTIONS`
is exactly those seven, with `SCRUTINY_LEVELS = ['LOW','MEDIUM','HIGH','CRITICAL']` as a
separate constant. `src/tools/specialist/activation.tool.ts:211,224` states the same seven.

Note for whoever implements: the project `CLAUDE.md` orchestration paragraph writes the
contract as "PROBLEM / SUCCESS / SCRUTINY / SCOPE / NON_GOALS / CONSTRAINTS / VALIDATION /
OUTPUT" — eight names for what it calls a 7-section contract. That doc line is the source of
this error and disagrees with the gate. Confirmed at CLAUDE.md:253; filed as bead
unitAI-lv1up. Out of scope for E1.

### Rulings on the §8 open items

1. **Landing route.** `unitAI-aiwva.2` promotes when `xt/fj3f` (E3) merges to `master`. A Pi
   executor implements file-by-file from this design; this session verifies
   post-implementation. E1 is not claimed or written before that merge.
2. **`package.json` `files`.** Belongs in E1 — without `"plugins/substrate/"` nothing ships.
   The release bead only cuts the release.
3. **Hook successor.** E1 marks `config/hooks/specialists-session-start.mjs` deprecated (docs
   note plus a removal bead). The plugin hook is authoritative where installed. No
   self-suppression logic in the plugin hook.

### Standing state

Design frozen pending the E3 merge signal. No repo file written; no claim on
`unitAI-aiwva.2`.

---

## 10. Base precondition verified — 2026-09-10

Checked against `origin/master` after `git fetch`:

- `2105ad1a` "Wave E E3+E4: SDK v2 strict MCP server + specialist_resume (t2kol parity
  preserved) (#313)" is on `origin/master`.
- `src/mcp/v2-server.ts` present (192 lines): `serveStdio(() => buildV2Server(),
  { legacy: 'reject' })` from `@modelcontextprotocol/server/stdio`.
- Seven tools registered: `use_specialist`, `specialist_status`, `specialist_dispatch`,
  `specialist_reply`, `specialist_resume`, `specialist_stop_activation`, `specialist_list`.
- `src/index.ts:1453` — no subcommand starts v2 strict 2026-07-28 by default;
  `SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER=legacy` selects the handwritten 2025-era server.

Consequence for `.mcp.json` (§5): shipping no `env` block is confirmed correct against the
merged default. Any value for `SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER` in the plugin could only pin users
backwards to the legacy server.

**Squash caveat, carried into §0:** the original branch commits are not ancestors of
`master`. Any precondition gate the executor or CI writes must assert file content, not
commit ancestry.

---

## 11. Verification of implementation fb9bb26e — 2026-09-10

Verifier: this session, against the live tree at `fb9bb26e` in a detached worktree.
Verdict: **FAIL — one blocking defect.** Everything else matches the design.

### BLOCKING — `.mcp.json` `command` must be `bun`, not `node`

The plugin can never start its MCP server as shipped.

Evidence:
```
$ echo '<discover>' | node plugins/substrate/scripts/mcp-server.mjs
[specialists] [ERROR] Bun runtime required (>=1.0.0).

$ echo '<discover>' | bun plugins/substrate/scripts/mcp-server.mjs
[specialists] [INFO] Specialists MCP Server v2 (2026-07-28, strict) started — 7 tools registered
```
Cause: `dist/index.js` is built `bun build --target=bun`; `src/index.ts:19` hard-guards the
runtime; `package.json` declares `engines.bun >= 1.0.0` and no node engine.

**This defect originated in the design (§5), not in the implementation.** The executor built
exactly what was specified. §5 is now corrected to `"command": "bun"`.

Required changes:
1. `plugins/substrate/.mcp.json` — `"command": "bun"`.
2. `plugins/substrate/hooks/hooks.json` — same question for both hook commands. The hook
   scripts are plain ESM using `node:sqlite` and DO run under node, so `node` is defensible
   there; but a plugin that requires bun for its server and node for its hooks depends on
   two runtimes. Recommend `bun` for all three, one prerequisite.
3. `tests/unit/mcp/substrate-plugin-paths.test.ts` — add a fourth case asserting
   `.mcp.json` `command === 'bun'`, so this cannot regress.
4. `scripts/mcp-server.mjs` — the failure message should name bun as the prerequisite.

L3 is otherwise proven: the launcher resolves the runtime, and the v2 strict 2026-07-28
server boots with 7 tools registered. Strict version rejection also observed live (a request
without a protocol version returned `-32022 Unsupported protocol version`, `supported:
["2026-07-28"]`).

### Independently reproduced

- **L1** `claude plugin validate ./plugins/substrate --strict` → "Validation passed", exit 0
  (claude 2.1.267).
- **L2** `bun --bun vitest run tests/unit/mcp/substrate-plugin-paths.test.ts` → 3 passed.
- Design conformance: `plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, `hooks.json`, `mcp-server.mjs` match the
  frozen design byte-for-byte apart from the `node`/`bun` defect above. `SKILL.md` carries
  the corrected SCRUTINY wording. `package.json:38` adds `"plugins/substrate/"`.
  `config/hooks/specialists-session-start.mjs` carries the deprecation note naming
  `unitAI-aiwva.15`.

### Non-blocking findings

1. **SessionStart hook is a permanent silent no-op today, and its schema is unverified.**
   `~/.xtrm/state.db` does not exist yet (wave E2 has not landed), and the hook's query
   assumes a table `activations` with columns `activation_id, specialist, state, bead_id,
   last_activity_at`. Nothing has ever exercised that query. The exit-0 discipline means a
   wrong table or column name is indistinguishable from "no activations" — silent forever.
   When E2 lands, this query MUST be re-verified against the real schema.
2. **Banner prints with zero rows.** The design said the hook emits nothing when there are
   no activations; the implementation prints the authority line whenever the store exists.
   Benign, arguably better. Noted so the design and code agree.
3. **Launcher branch 1 is stronger than designed.** `require.resolve('@jaggerxtrm/specialists')`
   succeeds in a dev checkout via package self-reference, resolving to the checkout's own
   `dist/index.js`. Branch 2 is a genuine fallback, not the normal dev path.
4. **Unreproduced status-console flake** claimed unrelated by the lane. Not verified here;
   a negative is not cheaply provable. Recommend it be tracked in its own bead rather than
   accepted as noise inside E1.

### Ruling requested: `.gitignore`

Root `.gitignore:28` ignores `.mcp.json` at any depth, so
`plugins/substrate/.mcp.json` needed `git add -f` and is now tracked against a live ignore
rule. Recommend fixing in E1, not deferring to `.15`: add `!plugins/substrate/.mcp.json`
immediately after line 28. One line. E1 introduced the file, E1's own L2 test reads it, and
a contributor who deletes and re-creates it will silently lose it.

## 12. Re-verification of 41de1b61 — 2026-09-10

Verifier: this session, live tree at `41de1b61` in a detached worktree.
Verdict: **PASS.** The §11 blocking defect is fixed and L3 is proven end-to-end.

Diff from `fb9bb26e` is exactly the four required changes plus the gitignore ruling:
`.mcp.json` command → `bun`; both `hooks.json` commands → `bun`; launcher message names bun;
`!plugins/substrate/.mcp.json` added; L2 gains a fourth case.

### L3 — live server start, driven from the declared config

The test parses `plugins/substrate/.mcp.json`, expands `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and executes
the command as written rather than typing a runtime by hand. It also asserts no `env` key
has reappeared.

```
executing exactly as declared: bun <root>/scripts/mcp-server.mjs
[specialists] [INFO] Specialists MCP Server v2 (2026-07-28, strict) started — 7 tools registered
```

`tools/list` at revision 2026-07-28, with the full `_meta` envelope
(`protocolVersion`, `clientCapabilities`, `clientInfo`), returned all seven:

```
specialist_dispatch, specialist_list, specialist_reply, specialist_resume,
specialist_status, specialist_stop_activation, use_specialist
```

Strict negotiation confirmed on the failure side too: omitting the protocol version yields
`-32022` with `supported: ["2026-07-28"]`, and an incomplete envelope yields `-32602`
naming the missing key. The server is genuinely strict, not permissive with a strict label.

### Other layers re-run

- **L1** `claude plugin validate ./plugins/substrate --strict` → passed, exit 0.
- **L2** 4/4 passed, including the new `command === 'bun'` regression guard.
- **Hooks under bun** — both `hooks.json` commands executed as declared: exit 0, no stdout,
  no stderr, with `~/.xtrm/state.db` absent and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` set to a temp dir. The
  exit-0-always discipline holds under the new runtime.
- **gitignore** — `git check-ignore` exits 1 for `plugins/substrate/.mcp.json`: no longer
  ignored, so the file is tracked without a force-add.

### Carried forward — unchanged by this fix

§11 non-blocking finding 1 still stands and is the one thing that must not be forgotten:
the SessionStart hook's query against `activations` in `~/.xtrm/state.db` remains
**unexercised and unverifiable** until wave E2 creates that store. Its exit-0 discipline
means a wrong table or column name will present as "no activations" forever. Re-verify the
query against the real schema when E2 lands.

The status-console flake remains unverified here and should be tracked in its own bead.

E1 packaging is complete and correct as of `41de1b61`.

---

## 13. E5 verification — 7fb1fc0e + 7fbedc76 — 2026-09-10

Verdict: **PASS on the evidence. One correction to the framing that reached me.**

### Reproduced independently

Ran `scripts/e5-packaged-plugin-e2e.mjs` myself in a detached worktree after
`bun install --frozen-lockfile`: **13 PASS + 1 UNPROVEN**, exactly as reported.
Notable steps proven live: `server/discover` advertising only `2026-07-28`; legacy
`initialize` rejected with `-32022`; 7-tool surface in deterministic order including
`specialist_resume`; a real `tools/call`; the packaged plugin loading under
`claude --plugin-dir` with an `E5-LOAD-OK` marker; post-compaction state re-derived from the
store rather than summary prose. Unit tests: 9 passed across the two plugin test files.

The harness is honest. It reports env-blocked steps as UNPROVEN with a named owner rather
than as green, and its one UNPROVEN row names the true cause and the fix branch.

### Correction — the E2 attribution is wrong

The message I received said session-start rows are silent "because E2 is unmerged" and asked
me to "confirm the E2-merge flips that link". **It will not.** The silence is a runtime
defect, not store absence.

`hooks.json` pins session-start to `bun` (my §11 recommendation, merged). `session-start.mjs`
on master imports `node:sqlite`, which bun does not provide:

```
$ bun -e "await import('node:sqlite')"
No such built-in module: node:sqlite
```

The import throws, the blanket try/catch swallows it, and the hook exits 0 silently.

Proven against ONE populated fixture store carrying the schema session-start expects:

| Script | Runtime | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `session-start.mjs` (master) | node | prints banner + `act-1` row |
| `session-start.mjs` (master) | **bun** | **silent, exit 0** |
| `precompact.mjs` (has the `bun:sqlite`-first fix, 7fb1fc0e) | bun | reads the same store, captures `act-1` |
| `session-start.mjs` (`origin/feature/unitAI-aiwva.3-authority`) | bun | prints banner + `act-1` row |

So the store, the schema, and the query are all fine under bun. What is broken is the driver
import in one script. `7fb1fc0e` gave precompact an `openStore()` helper that tries
`bun:sqlite` first; session-start never received it. The fix exists on
`origin/feature/unitAI-aiwva.3-authority` (NOT merged) and is verified above to work.

**Consequence for E2 promotion:** merging E2 alone leaves session-start silent forever. The
`.3-authority` session-start driver fix must merge as well. If E2 lands without it, the hook
will present a populated store as "no activations" — indistinguishable from correct
behaviour, which is the §11 finding-1 failure mode arriving for real.

### Verification-scope caveat

The `same-store` link that PASSes is gated on the **node** invocation
(`nodeRowsOk`), while `hooks.json` ships **bun**. The green link therefore evidences the
query and the override scoping, not the shipped path. The harness does not hide this — the
adjacent UNPROVEN row covers it — but the two must be read together, and `same-store` alone
must not be cited as proof that SessionStart works as shipped.

### Not a repo defect

My first harness run failed on a missing `@modelcontextprotocol/server`. That is local
environment staleness in `~/dev/specialists/node_modules`, not a branch problem: master's
`bun.lock` carries the package (added in `2105ad1a`), and `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
resolved it. Retracted as a finding.

## 14. E5 fully green on current master — 2026-09-10

`feature/unitAI-aiwva.4-e5` (PR #322, commits `7fb1fc0e` + `7fbedc76`) merged locally with
`origin/master` and re-run: **14 PASS, 0 UNPROVEN, RESULT: PASS.**

The §13 UNPROVEN row `sessionstart-bun-rows` now passes — "pinned runtime projects rows" —
because E2 (#316) merged the `bun:sqlite`-first `openStore()` into `session-start.mjs:27`.
The harness proves the shipped path under the pinned bun runtime, not only the node
invocation, so the §13 scope caveat on `same-store` is discharged.

Nothing in the harness or the plugin changed to achieve this; only the base moved. #322
should be rebased or merged onto current master before landing so CI observes the same
14/14.

## 15. Live-session usability check — 2026-09-10 — TWO DEFECTS

Question asked: how far are we from a real Claude Code session actually using the plugin?
Answer: **not there yet.** Two defects, the first of them mine.

### RESOLVED FIRST — §11 finding 1 is discharged

`~/.xtrm/state.db` now exists (1.1M) and its `activations` table has exactly the five columns
session-start queries: `activation_id, specialist, state, bead_id, last_activity_at`. The
schema assumption I flagged twice as unverified is now verified against the real store.

### DEFECT 1 (mine, blocking) — `plugin.json` must declare `mcpServers`

My design omitted `mcpServers` from the manifest on the assumption that a plugin's `.mcp.json`
is auto-discovered by convention. **That assumption is false and was never tested.**

As shipped on master:
```
$ claude --plugin-dir ~/dev/specialists/plugins/substrate -p "name every MCP tool containing 'specialist'"
NONE
```
The plugin loads, `claude plugin validate --strict` passes, and no substrate tool exists in
the session. The MCP server is never wired.

Adding one field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:
```json
"mcpServers": "./.mcp.json"
```
changes it to:
```
$ claude --plugin-dir <copy> mcp list | grep substrate
plugin:substrate:substrate: bun <root>/scripts/mcp-server.mjs - ✔ Connected
```
`claude plugin validate --strict` still passes with the field present.

This is the same class as the `command: "node"` defect: an unverified design assumption that
only a live check exposes. Note the §2 rationale table explicitly justified omitting
`mcpServers` as "auto-discovered; an explicit list is a second source of truth". That
reasoning was wrong.

### DEFECT 2 (unknown owner, blocking) — only 1 of 7 tools reaches the session

With the server connected, the session sees exactly one tool:
```
mcp__plugin_substrate_substrate__use_specialist
```
The six activation tools — `specialist_dispatch`, `specialist_status`, `specialist_reply`,
`specialist_resume`, `specialist_stop_activation`, `specialist_list` — do not appear.
Confirmed not a deferred-tool artifact: an in-session `ToolSearch` for
`select:mcp__plugin_substrate_substrate__specialist_status` returned "No matching deferred
tools found", and a search for "specialist" returned exactly one match.

The server itself is not at fault — raw JSON-RPC `tools/list` against the same launcher
returns all seven (§12). So the drop happens between the v2 server and Claude Code's MCP
client. Root cause not determined here. One hypothesis worth testing first: `use_specialist`
is the only tool whose schema does not go through the v2 `fromJsonSchema(zodToJsonSchema(...))`
path, so a schema construct Claude's client rejects would drop exactly the other six.

Owner: Wave E / E3-E4, not E1 packaging.

### Why E5's 14/14 did not catch either

`claude-live-load` asserts only that `claude --plugin-dir <plugin> -p "Reply with exactly:
E5-LOAD-OK"` exits 0 and echoes the marker. It proves the CLI starts with the plugin
directory present. It never asserts the plugin was enabled, the MCP server connected, or any
tool was exposed. Every other MCP proof in the harness speaks JSON-RPC to the server
directly, bypassing Claude Code's own client entirely.

**Recommended harness addition:** one step that asserts, through Claude Code itself, that the
expected tool names are present — the only check that would have caught both defects.

## 16. Root cause of the live-session failures — 2026-09-10

Investigated live. **My §15 Defect 2 diagnosis was wrong.** It is not a client-side schema
drop. There are two independent causes, and one of them is a hard blocker.

### RETRACTED: the schema hypothesis

§15 speculated that Claude's client rejects the six activation tools' schemas because
`use_specialist` is the only one bypassing `fromJsonSchema(zodToJsonSchema(...))`. False.
That evidence came from a `/var/tmp` copy of the plugin whose launcher resolved to a
different runtime, which invalidated the observation.

### CAUSE A (blocking, spec-vs-reality) — Claude Code speaks 2025-11-25

```
$ claude --plugin-dir <worktree>/plugins/substrate mcp list
plugin:substrate:substrate: ✘ Failed to connect — -32022: Unsupported protocol version: 2025-11-25
```

Claude Code 2.1.267 negotiates MCP **2025-11-25**. The v2 server is strict 2026-07-28 served
with `{ legacy: 'reject' }` (§J). It therefore refuses Claude Code outright. **The v2 server
cannot be used by the shipping Claude Code client at all** — zero tools, no connection.

Spec §F/§J mandated 2026-07-28 strict as "verified against live Claude Code documentation on
2026-09-09". The live CLI disagrees with that. This needs an owner decision, not a patch from
me: either the plugin serves a client-compatible revision until Claude Code ships 2026-07-28,
or the plugin is knowingly non-functional on current Claude Code.

**Verified correction (experiment only, not written):** forcing the legacy server via
`env: { "SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER": "legacy" }` in `.mcp.json` connects and exposes all seven
tools through Claude Code:
```
specialist_dispatch, specialist_list, specialist_reply, specialist_retry,
specialist_status, specialist_stop_activation, use_specialist
```
Note the legacy surface has `specialist_retry`, NOT `specialist_resume` — so this workaround
costs the E4 parity item. That is the trade to decide.

This also reverses my §5 "ship no env block" ruling for as long as the workaround stands.

### CAUSE B (blocking, mine) — the launcher resolves to a stale global cache

Under bun, `require.resolve('@jaggerxtrm/specialists')` from a plugin directory with no local
`node_modules` resolves into bun's global install cache:
```
~/.bun/install/cache/@jaggerxtrm/specialists@3.21.6@@@1/dist/index.js
```
That published copy contains no v2 server (`grep -c 2026-07-28` → 0) and serves exactly
`['use_specialist']` — which is precisely what the earlier session saw. My launcher silently
prefers a stale published runtime over the plugin's own build.

This is the exact failure I named when rejecting the `npx` option in §5 — "floats the runtime
version away from the installed plugin version" — reintroduced by branch 1 of my own
launcher under bun's resolution rules.

**Correction:** resolve the plugin's own runtime first and treat the package name as the
fallback, not the reverse; or verify the resolved artifact carries the expected build before
importing it.

### CAUSE C (needs an owner, not blocking) — `specialist_status` returns 2.19 MB

Called live through Claude Code, `specialist_status` returned **2,193,692 bytes / 95,440
lines** — the full specialist registry plus ~3,228 job records (`specialist`, `status`,
`is_dead`, `elapsed_s`, `metrics`, `turns`, `tool_calls`). The session refused to paste it and
spilled it to a file.

PRD §13.1 specifies a compact projection: live activation rows only, forensic IDs excluded.
A 2 MB payload would consume a large fraction of a session's context on one call. Whether the
v2 `specialist_status` has the same shape is untested — this was the legacy tool under the
Cause A workaround.

### Harness step that would have caught all of this

The E5 gap is that every MCP assertion speaks JSON-RPC directly to the server, and the only
Claude-Code-level check asserts process startup. Required addition:

1. `claude --plugin-dir <plugin> mcp list` → assert the server line reads **Connected**.
   This alone catches Cause A and Cause B, and would have failed today.
2. `claude --plugin-dir <plugin> -p "<list tool names>"` → assert every expected tool name is
   present, by exact name.
3. One real tool call through Claude Code, asserting a bounded response size.

Step 1 is one command and is the highest-value check in the whole plan.

## 17. Durable fix for Cause A, and the Cause C correction — 2026-09-10

### Cause A — SOLVED by one word, no downgrade, no parity loss

The SDK's `serveStdio` `legacy` option takes three values, not two:
`'reject' | 'serve' | 'stateless'` — and `'serve'` is the SDK default. We chose `'reject'`
(§J), which is what refuses Claude Code.

Verified live on a worktree of master with `legacy: 'serve'` and a rebuilt `dist`:

```
$ claude --plugin-dir <w>/plugins/substrate mcp list
plugin:substrate:substrate: bun <w>/plugins/substrate/scripts/mcp-server.mjs - ✔ Connected

$ claude ... -p "list tools starting with mcp__plugin_substrate"
specialist_dispatch, specialist_list, specialist_reply, specialist_resume,
specialist_status, specialist_stop_activation, use_specialist
```

All seven, including `specialist_resume` — NOT the legacy `specialist_retry`. And the modern
path is unaffected: a raw 2026-07-28 `tools/list` still returns 7 tools, while a legacy
`initialize` now answers `protocolVersion: 2025-11-25` instead of `-32022`.

One server, both revisions. This supersedes the §16 `SPECIALISTS_MCP_SERVER=legacy`
workaround, which cost the E4 parity item, and it keeps the §5 "no env block" ruling intact.
It also needs no change when Claude Code ships a 2026-07-28 client.

**Exact correction:** `src/mcp/v2-server.ts:184`, `legacy: 'reject'` → `legacy: 'serve'`,
plus the file-header comment on line 4 and the "strict" wording in the startup log, which
would otherwise assert something untrue. Owner: E3.

### On "is stdio the wrong transport"

No. The protocol revision is chosen by the client, not the transport: Claude Code sends
`initialize` at 2025-11-25 over stdio and never attempts `server/discover`. Moving to HTTP
would still be the same client choosing the same revision.

More importantly, **fire-and-wake was never an MCP capability**. Statelessness in 2026-07-28
means the server holds no connection-scoped state (§G) — it does not mean the server can push
into an idle session. MCP remains client-initiated request/response in both revisions. The
spec's own decision matrix (§AF) assigns wake to different primitives entirely:

```
local continuous stream        → plugin monitor            (§Y)
one condition wakes idle Claude → asyncRewake hook          (§Z)
push into an OPEN session      → Claude Channel            (§U)
Claude → Claude                → SendMessage               (§AD)
durable work authority         → NONE OF THESE → Substrate Issue
```

So the durable architecture decouples the two concerns, and neither depends on the MCP
revision:

- **MCP = command surface.** dispatch / status / reply / resume / stop / list. Must speak
  whatever revision the installed client speaks — hence `legacy: 'serve'`.
- **Wake = plugin monitor or asyncRewake hook** reading Substrate directly. This is wave E6
  (already merged, #318) and is where fire-and-wake actually lives.

The plugin already holds a SessionStart hook that reads `~/.xtrm/state.db`. An `asyncRewake`
hook over the same store is the fire-and-wake path, and it is independent of MCP entirely.

### Cause C — cleanest fix is deletion, and it closes a parity gap

The Pi extension does NOT have this defect. Its `specialist_status` states plainly: "No CLI
background jobs are shown — this surface only hosts in-process activations", and it projects
`host.list()` only.

The MCP tool diverges by adding two unbounded sections:
- `background_jobs` — fed by `listStatuses()`, which is
  `SELECT status_json FROM specialist_jobs ORDER BY updated_at_ms DESC` with **no LIMIT**.
  3,228 rows here, each with `metrics`, `turns`, `tool_calls`. This is ~all of the 2.19 MB.
- `specialists` — the full registry with per-specialist staleness, which is what
  `specialist_list` already exists to return.

**Correction: remove both from `specialist_status`, converging the MCP projection onto the Pi
shape.** That is PRD §13.1's specified projection — activations, pending asks, results,
backends health — and it fixes the token problem by deleting duplication rather than by
adding a cap that later drifts. `specialist_list` keeps the registry; job listing stays CLI
territory (`sp ps`), or earns a separate bounded tool if MCP genuinely needs it.

Do **not** add a LIMIT inside `listStatuses()`: ten CLI callers (`clean`, `console/runtime`,
`db`, `doctor`, `end`, `list`) legitimately want every row.

Owner: E4 / whoever owns `src/tools/specialist/specialist_status.tool.ts`. Affects the v2
server too — `v2-server.ts:110` imports the same factory, so this is not a legacy-only bug.

### PRD §13.1 parity — checked, and NOT the gap I expected

I expected `thinking_level`, `purpose` and `token_usage` to be missing from the MCP
projection. They are present, with the exact §13.1 semantics — conditional spreads at
`activation.tool.ts:106-108`, so each is omitted when unset rather than fabricated. Dispatch
carries `epic_context_depth`, `coordinator_session_id`, `requested_by`, `model_override`,
`thinking_override`. Build identity is rendered (4 call sites). Workspace lease admission
lives in the shared host.

Remaining §13.1 divergences, both understood:
- **Wake notifications** (`specialist_ask` / `specialist_settled` follow-ups): no MCP
  equivalent. This is .21, unbuilt. On Claude the coordinator polls `specialist_status`.
- **Fleet UI footer seam** (`registerFooterSection`): Pi-runtime-specific. Claude Code has no
  equivalent seam, so this is not a portable requirement.

### What "complete" is actually gated on

1. A §AJ amendment for the protocol criterion, or the shipped server permanently violates the
   spec and someone eventually reverts it.
2. Substrate IssueService, for .9/.10/.11 — and §AJ names ProvenanceService by itself.
3. .21, if fire-and-wake is in scope for "concluded".

Everything else in §AJ is satisfied with live evidence.

## 19. Corrections log — claims I made that did not survive checking

Recorded because the recurring failure in this programme is an assertion that reads as
proof of something it does not prove. Three of those were mine.

### 19.1 `command: "node"` in `.mcp.json` (design §5, caught at §11)

Asserted the launcher should run under node. `dist/index.js` is built `--target=bun` and
`src/index.ts:19` hard-guards the runtime, so the server could never start. Survived design
approval, an executor, and the lane's own L1/L2/L4 evidence — four checkpoints — because
every one of them read the artifact instead of running it.

### 19.2 `mcpServers` omitted from the manifest (design §2, caught at §15)

The §2 rationale table justified the omission: "auto-discovered; an explicit list is a second
source of truth that drifts". The premise was invented and never tested. A plugin's
`.mcp.json` is not auto-discovered, so the server was never wired and the session saw zero
tools. Same class as 19.1: a confident reason for a decision that no check covered.

### 19.3 "Substrate skill is discoverable" counted as satisfied (caught by the auditor)

Verified it live once, saw `substrate:using-substrate` resolve, and called the criterion met.
A one-off manual check is not coverage — nothing would have caught its regression. It was the
only §AJ line with no automated assertion of any kind. Now gated (`client-skill`).

### 19.4 PRD §19.2 chain work — wrong twice, in opposite directions

First: "zero code, zero beads, unstarted, nobody has scoped it." False. PRD §22 states on the
same page I was quoting that the milestone is "owned by the XTRM runtime plan rather than this
PRD"; I quoted the page and did not follow the pointer.

Then, correcting it: "built and closed in xtrm." Also wrong — overstated in the other
direction.

True: all chain-runtime source lives under
`~/dev/xtrm/experiments/agentsession-sre-chain-vertical-slice/src/`, and no shipped package in
either repo imports it (`grep -rl 'newResolvedChain\|compileChain'` outside `experiments/` and
`docs/` returns nothing). Six of eight §19.2 criteria are satisfied inside that experiment;
19.2c is open on an unbuilt materializer; 19.2h is partially open because the data-authored
`sre-team.chain.json` is proven fingerprint-equivalent yet `cli/main.ts` still calls the
hard-coded `newResolvedChain`. Open bead `xtrm-q99` names that wiring.

The shared root cause of both halves: conflating **presence** with **shipped**. A grep hit is
not a deployment and a closed epic is not a wired runtime.

### What the pattern says

Every one of these was found by executing the thing rather than reading it, or by a second
party checking scope. None was found by more careful reading of the same artifact. That is the
argument for the client gate existing at all, and for stating repo scope and deployment status
on every cross-repo claim.
