# using-specialists: progressive disclosure — benchmark and review

Epic `unitAI-6639v`. Compares the pre-split skill (v3.7) with the router + references
layout (v3.8). Written at close of `unitAI-6639v.3`.

## Before / after

Measured once, at the close of `unitAI-6639v.3`, against v3.8 as it stood then.
This table is a dated benchmark of that one change. It is not a live description of the
files. For a current size, measure the file.

| | v3.7 (monolith) | v3.8 (router + references) |
|---|---|---|
| Files | 1 (`SKILL.md`) | 1 router + 6 references + 1 migration map |
| Root size | 1416 lines / 98,496 B | **256 lines / 21,689 B** |
| Eagerly injected into a coordinator session | the whole 98,496 B | the router only — **−78%** |
| Phase-specific doctrine | always loaded | loaded on demand, per phase |
| Sections | 41 | 41 (all preserved, none duplicated) |
| Asset-contract coverage | `SKILL.md` only | all 8 skill files, hashed |

One heading was retired after this benchmark, in `xtrm-wiy5n.4.20`. The authority for what
moved where, and for what was retired and why, is
`references/content-migration-map.json`, which the layout test checks. Prose does not track it.

The −78% is the number that matters: it is context every coordinator session paid on turn 1,
whether or not it ever merged anything.

## Layout

`SKILL.md` keeps only what gates *every* task — the 15 non-negotiable rules,
orchestration discipline, when to delegate, specialist choice, the promotion gate, Issue identity,
SCRUTINY, the escalation matrix, session-end handoff — plus a phase → reference routing table
and a five-gates index.

| Reference | Owns |
|---|---|
| `references/issue-contracts.md` | contract shape, per-type contracts, dependency vocabulary |
| `references/chain-recipes.md` | QA+Iron gates, single-chain, epic, review/fix loop, mini-flows |
| `references/dispatch-preconditions.md` | Git State Precondition, conflict clusters, test-failure maps |
| `references/monitoring.md` | sleep timers, observability-DB notification, steering, rebuttal |
| `references/merge-and-integration.md` | manual merge, Cherry-Pick Playbook, restitch, smoke, recovery |
| `references/registry-and-locations.md` | where specialists live, registry/help, adjacent `xt` commands |

`references/content-migration-map.json` maps every original heading to its destination, so
"no content was lost" is machine-checkable rather than asserted.

## How the split was done

Sections were extracted **verbatim by line range via script**, never re-typed or summarized.
The first cut left the router at 124 lines — under the 250–350 budget. Rather than pad it, the
sections consulted on *every* task (specialist choice, promotion gate, Issue identity, SCRUTINY,
escalation) were promoted from the references into the router and removed from those references.
Result: in budget, zero duplication.

Cross-references between files (rule 14 naming the Git State Precondition; the merge doc pointing
back at it) are deliberate — they are pointers, not copies. The invariant enforced by tests is
*section ownership*: each authoritative section body lives in exactly one file.

## Evidence

**Deterministic.**
`tests/unit/skills/using-specialists-layout.test.ts` — line budget, link reachability, no
content loss, no duplication, migration-map completeness, asset-contract hash parity, fresh-install
`cpSync` mirror, selective loading.
`tests/unit/skills/selective-loading.test.ts` — one owner per phase, router routes to it, and
the router alone answers always-needed questions.
`tests/unit/skills/role-envelope-parity.test.ts` — the prompt-envelope parity matrix.
`tests/unit/specialist/using-specialists-evals.test.ts` — eval-set guard, incl. the three new
progressive-disclosure scenarios.

**Negative proof.** The budget test fails on the old layout by construction (1416 > 350), and the
`.2.1` skill-path suite fails 8/9 on unfixed master. The tests catch the bugs; they do not merely pass.

**Live smoke** (against the globally installed v3.8, through the Pi runtime root):

```
$ pi --skill ~/.xtrm/skills/default/using-specialists/SKILL.md --print \
    "I am about to merge a finished chain. Which reference does the router send me to? State rule 9."
references/merge-and-integration.md
Rule 9: ... manual git (Cherry-Pick Playbook, FF, or `git merge --no-ff`); never `sp merge` / `sp epic merge`.
```

Routed correctly, and answered rule 9 **from the router alone** — no reference loaded. Then:

```
$ pi --skill .../SKILL.md --print "Follow the router: open the reference for MERGING and read it..."
/home/dawid/.pi/agent/skills/using-specialists/references/merge-and-integration.md
Cherry-Pick Playbook
```

The on-demand resource resolved through `~/.pi/agent/skills` — the real runtime startup root.

**Install parity.** `diff -r` source vs `~/.xtrm/skills/default/using-specialists` → identical; all 7
router links resolve from the installed location; reachable via both `~/.pi/agent/skills` and
`~/.claude/skills`.

## Prompt-envelope parity matrix

Task-side content for the three surfaces, per the `unitAI-6639v.1` decision:

| Layer | `sp run` | `xt pi --role` | `xt claude --role` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_template` + bead/dependency context | yes | yes | yes |
| MANDATORY_RULES (≤2000 tok, else dropped) | yes | yes | yes |
| `prompt.system` | never on the task side | never | never |
| `$pre_script_output` (executes shell) | yes | **no** — execution-only | **no** |
| reviewer git-diff context (executes git) | yes (reviewer only) | **no** — execution-only | **no** |
| mandatory-rule resolution failure | warn + skip | **fatal** | **fatal** |
| `prompt_hash` | sha256[0:16] over the rendered task | identical when no execution-only layer applies | identical |

`pi` and `claude` are byte-identical on the task side — `--surface` is recorded as metadata and must
never alter content (test-enforced). All three are produced by **one** seam,
`src/specialist/task-prompt.ts:renderTaskPrompt`, so the matrix cannot drift.

## Launcher smoke (post-merge, v3.20.0)

Run against the **installed** `xt` (0.10.6) and the **published** `sp` (3.20.0), no wrapper:

```
$ xt pi --role chain-coordinator --bead unitAI-6639v --no-attach --new-session
role-pi-chain-coordinator-unitai-6639v:%4156
```

The live session lists `using-specialists` (v3.8, router + 7 references) and `multiplexing`
in its skill registry, resolved from `~/.pi/agent/skills` → `~/.xtrm/skills/default`. Asked which
reference the router sends it to for merging, the coordinator opened **only** `SKILL.md`
(the router, not the monolith) and answered:

```
Reference: references/merge-and-integration.md
Rule 9: ... never use sp merge or sp epic merge because both are broken.
Opened: /home/dawid/.pi/agent/skills/using-specialists/SKILL.md
```

Progressive disclosure holds end to end in the real launcher: routed correctly, recited rule 9 from
the router alone, and pulled in no irrelevant reference.

## Known limitations

- **Claude role behaviour** is covered by the same deterministic contract plus the
  `~/.claude/skills` reachability check, not a live Claude session.
- `xt pi --role` does not inject the rendered task prompt into the pane; it only sets
  `@agent_task` / `@agent_bead`. Feeding it `sp render-task` output is core-side work, tracked
  outside this repo.
