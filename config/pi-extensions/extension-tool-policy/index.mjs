// Specialists-owned extension tool policy (unitAI-34pyf) + advisory (unitAI-kaae7).
//
// Loaded LAST (-e) by the specialist spawn when execution.extensions sources
// are enabled, together with `--no-builtin-tools`. At session_start every
// extension is registered, so the policy reads the full tool registry via
// pi.getAllTools() and activates exactly:
//   1. the tier's native tools (strict allowlist delivered through the
//      bounded env channel PI_SPECIALIST_ALLOWED_NATIVE_TOOLS), and
//   2. every tool whose source is NOT builtin/sdk — i.e. tools registered
//      by the explicitly enabled extension sources (operator trust signal:
//      enabling a source authorizes its code).
// Everything else (including future/unknown builtins such as powershell)
// stays inactive and is rejected by Pi at call time — fail-closed.
//
// At before_agent_start the same extension appends a concise, non-mandatory
// advisory listing the ACTIVE high-leverage tools (intersected with a
// reviewed static guidance map) so agents use tools they actually have.
// Rationale: the advisory must be derived from runtime-confirmed active tool
// names — never from configured sources (a source may be enabled yet its
// tools denied/unhealthy). The policy extension is the single owner of that
// active set, so the advisory reuses it here instead of duplicating the
// selection in Specialists role output or Core ambient discovery.
//
// The active-set selection must mirror selectExtensionPolicyTools in
// tests/unit/pi/extension-tool-policy.test.ts; keep both in sync.
