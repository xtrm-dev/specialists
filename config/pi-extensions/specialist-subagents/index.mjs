// config/pi-extensions/specialist-subagents/index.mjs
//
// The PRIMARY coordinator surface named in the PRD — the Pi extension over
// `NativeActivationHost`. MCP (integrations/claude-code) is the other frontend;
// both serialise the SAME `InteractionMessage` protocol and the SAME
// `ActivationSnapshot` projection, and neither spawns a process. A tool that
// shelled out to `sp run` would satisfy the letter of "dispatch a Specialist"
// and defeat the entire purpose of the native runtime; nothing in this file
// constructs a child process (VALIDATION 2 asserts this on the process table).
//
// What this file does NOT do (and why):
//   - No permission logic. The capability invariant (PRD §112) — extension
//     installed != extension selected != capability granted — is enforced by the
//     host: only the resolved tool contract reaches the child session, plus the
//     two ask/escalate tools, fail-closed. `extension-tool-policy` remains the
//     single selector; nothing here reimplements it (PRD §113).
//   - No scheduler and no workflow engine (PRD non-goals). Dispatch is one
//     activation; the Fleet Registry inside the host is the persistent state.
//   - No second message vocabulary (PRD invariant BH). `specialist_reply`
//     correlates on `message_id` and nothing else; the answer returns as the
//     child's ask-tool result, resuming the same AgentSession.
//
// The host is a process-lifetime singleton created on first tool use: the
// FleetRegistry inside it is the seam that survives a turn boundary (VALIDATION
// 5). A per-turn host would answer `specialist_status` with an empty Fleet while
// children were still running.
//
// POLLING BUDGET (measured, not guessed): a child turn on a typical small model
// takes ~2 minutes (120s observed with deepseek-v4-flash), and the coordinator
// must keep polling specialist_status across the whole window. A loop that ends
// before settlement returns an empty result that looks like a fast failure —
// budget >= 3 minutes of polling before concluding an activation is stuck.

 *
 * The boundary this does NOT cover, stated rather than implied: `pi.exec` and direct

// is what constructs that sink — so observing asks costs a wrapper here and no
// change to the host, to `InteractionTransport`, or to `NativeActivationHostDeps`.

// The property that matters is what this DOES NOT touch. `DeliveryState` lives in
// the transport and the wake never reaches it, so an ask stays `pending` and stays
// readable through `specialist_status` whether the wake fires, is disabled, or
// throws. Push cannot become authoritative because it has no way to say otherwise
// (PRD SS30) — that is a consequence of where the seam is, not of care at the call
// site.
//
// Timing note, measured rather than assumed: `ask-tool.ts` calls `onAsk` BEFORE
// `transport.request()`, so at notification time the ask is not yet in
// `pendingAsks()` and no `message_id` exists to carry. The wake therefore carries
// the activation identity and the question, and the coordinator reads
// `specialist_status` for the id. That keeps the durable projection as the single
// correlation authority; a message_id sourced from anywhere else would be a second
// one for the exact thing that must have only one.

  // ── Operator surface (unitAI-rrdnt.46) ─────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Everything above this line is a MODEL surface: it exists only when the
  // coordinator decides to call a tool. An operator in an interactive TUI saw
  // nothing at all — no Fleet, no pending ask, no way to answer one. The PRD
  // says this extension owns a child viewport; it owned none.
  //
  // Measured against pi 0.85.1 before any of this was written (the SDK types at
  // dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts and @aliou/pi-processes as the worked
  // example), then proved in a live TUI: `pi.registerCommand` produces a real
  // slash command with argument completion, and `ctx.ui.setWidget` paints a
  // persistent panel above or below the editor. Neither needed a host change.
  //
  // The view is a PROJECTION and never a second source of state. Every repaint
  // reads `host.list()` and `host.pendingAsks()` afresh; nothing is cached
  // between ticks, because a cache would drift exactly when something
  // interesting happens. `toActivationView`/`toPendingAskView` are the same
  // projections the tools serialise, so the operator and the model are looking
  // at one vocabulary rather than two.
  //
  // Refresh is a poll, deliberately. `NativeActivationHost` is pull-only
  // (`list`, `pendingAsks`, `inspect`) and giving it an emitter whose only
  // subscriber is a widget would couple the host to a UI consumer for no
  // measured gain. A tick is a read of an in-memory Map. If the latency ever
  // shows in use, that is the evidence that justifies an emitter.

  // One capture of the live ExtensionContext, shared by every consumer in this
  // file (unitAI-rrdnt.45 wake-ups, unitAI-rrdnt.46 Fleet UI). Two independent
  // holders is how a stale ctx survives a session restart, so there is one.
