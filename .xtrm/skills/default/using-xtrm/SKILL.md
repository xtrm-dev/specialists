# XTRM — When to Use What

> Gates, commands, and git workflow are in CLAUDE.md.
> This is the behavioral layer: triggers, patterns, examples.

## Session Start

```bash
bd prime                          # load workflow context + active claims
bd memories <today's topic>       # retrieve relevant past context
bv --robot-triage                 # graph-ranked picks, quick wins, unblock targets
bd update <id> --claim            # claim before any edit
```

> Use `bv --robot-next` for the single top pick. Use `bv --robot-triage --format toon` to save context tokens. **Never run bare `bv` — it launches an interactive TUI.**

---

## Current xt Command Surfaces

Use these command surfaces when the task is operational rather than code-editing:

| Need | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Refresh xtrm-managed skills/hooks/reports in one repo | `xt update --apply` | Default `xt update` is dry-run; `--apply` writes. |
| Refresh many repos | `xt update --apply --root <dir>` | Discovers repos with `.xtrm/registry.json`; failures are reported per repo. |
| Cut a release | `xt release prepare --patch` then `xt release publish` | `prepare` drafts from xt reports; `publish` tags/pushes. If `prepare` fails on changelog script compatibility, check specialists `unitAI-dnmcg` state and use the manual fallback in `/releasing`. |
| Close a session report | update latest same-day `.xtrm/reports/<date>-*.md` | `session-close-report` prefers one same-day SSOT handoff; do not create duplicate reports unless asked. |


---

## Trigger Patterns

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User prompt contains `?` | `bd memories <keywords>` before answering — check stored context first |
| "What should I work on?" | `bv --robot-triage` — ranked picks with dependency context |
| "What was I working on?" | `bd list --status=in_progress` |
| Unfamiliar area of code | `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` before opening any file |
| About to edit a symbol | `gitnexus_impact({target: "name", direction: "upstream"})` |
| Before `git commit` | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` to verify scope |
| Reading code | `get_symbols_overview` → `find_symbol` — never read whole files |
| Task is tests | use /test-planning
| Task is docs updates | use /sync-docs
| Session end (issue closed) | Memory gate fires — evaluate `bd remember` for each closed issue |

---

## Handling `?` Prompts

When the user's message contains a question, check stored context before answering:

```bash
bd memories <keywords from question>   # search project memory
bd recall <key>                        # retrieve specific memory if key is known
```

Example — user asks *"why does the quality gate run twice?"*:
```bash
bd memories "quality gate"
# → "quality-check.cjs and quality-check.py are separate hooks —
#    JS/TS and Python each get their own PostToolUse pass"
```

If it's a code question, also run:
```bash
gitnexus_query({query: "<topic>"})     # find relevant execution flows
```

## Workflow Examples

**Fixing a bug:**
```bash
bd ready                                                        # find the issue
bd update bd-xyz --claim                                        # claim it
gitnexus_impact({target: "parseComposeServices", direction: "upstream"})
# → 2 callers, LOW risk — safe to edit
get_symbols_overview("hooks/init.ts")                           # map file
find_symbol("parseComposeServices", include_body=True)          # read just this
replace_symbol_body("parseComposeServices", newBody)            # Serena edit
bd close bd-xyz --reason="Fix YAML parse edge case"            # close issue
xt end                                                         # push, PR, merge, cleanup
```

**Exploring unfamiliar code:**
```bash
gitnexus_query({query: "session claim enforcement"})
# → beads-gate-core.mjs, resolveClaimAndWorkState, decideCommitGate
gitnexus_context({name: "resolveClaimAndWorkState"})            # callers + callees
get_symbols_overview("hooks/beads-gate-core.mjs")               # map the file
find_symbol("resolveClaimAndWorkState", include_body=True)      # read only this
```

**Persisting an insight:**
```bash
bd remember "quality-check runs twice: separate .cjs (JS) and .py (Python) hooks"
# retrievable next session:
bd memories "quality check"
bd recall "quality-check-runs-twice-..."
```

## Prompt Shaping (silent, before every non-trivial task)

| Task type | Apply |
|-----------|-------|
| `analyze / investigate / why` | `<thinking>` block + structured `<outputs>` |
| `implement / build / fix` | 1-2 `<example>` blocks + `<constraints>` |
| `refactor / simplify` | `<constraints>` (preserve behavior, tests pass) + `<current_state>` |

Vague prompt (under 8 words, no specifics)? Ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

---

## Skill Routing

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Code read / edit | Serena — `get_symbols_overview` → `find_symbol` → `replace_symbol_body` |
| Blast radius before edit | `gitnexus-impact-analysis` |
| Navigate unfamiliar code | `gitnexus-exploring` |
| Trace a bug | `gitnexus-debugging` |
| Safe rename / refactor | `gitnexus-refactoring` |
| Docs maintenance | `sync-docs` |
| Docker service project | `using-service-skills` |
| Build / improve a skill | `skill-creator` |
