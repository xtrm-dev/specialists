/**
 * Live smoke for the Claude Code MCP activation surface — bead unitAI-rrdnt.33.
 *
 * The unit tests in tests/unit/specialist/activation-mcp-tools.test.ts prove the tools
 * call the real host through the real gates, with the Pi SDK faked. That leaves the two
 * claims this phase actually exists to make unobserved:
 *
 *   AV — Claude Code launches a real Pi Specialist without `sp run`;
 *   AW — it does so without a separate terminal or `xt` session.
 *
 * Neither is provable in-process. "No `sp` was spawned" is a claim about the SYSTEM, and a
 * `vi.mock` of `spawn` proves only that this test's module graph did not call the function
 * it replaced. So this file drives the REAL built server (`dist/index.js`) over a REAL
 * stdio MCP client — which is exactly the arrangement Claude Code itself uses, hence AW —
 * and asserts against `/proc`: every transitive descendant of the server process is
 * enumerated while the Specialist is mid-turn, and none of them may be the legacy CLI.
 *
 * This epic has now been wrong four times about claims that passed inspection and were
 * falsified by a live probe (the procStart format, the receipt premise, a delivery
 * boundary, and the unwired workspace lease). The process table is the evidence.
 *
 * Gated on SPECIALISTS_LIVE_SMOKE=1 because it makes a real model call. It also needs the
 * build to be current and two real Beads — one dispatchable, one marked contract=draft:
 *
 *   bun run build
 *   SPECIALISTS_LIVE_SMOKE=1 \
 *   SPECIALISTS_MCP_PROBE_READY_BEAD=<a complete 7-section bead> \
 *   SPECIALISTS_MCP_PROBE_DRAFT_BEAD=<a bead with contract=draft> \
 *   SPECIALISTS_MCP_PROBE_MODEL=<provider/model> \
 *     bun --bun vitest run tests/integration/activation/mcp-activation.live.test.ts
 *
 *
 * Getting STATE out of a PASSING live case: vitest swallows `console.log` for tests that
 * pass, so a green run prints a pass count and nothing else — which is the exact shape
 * that let this epic nearly report an acceptance proven while the activation sat in
 * `failed`. Re-run with `--disable-console-intercept` to see the observed activation.
 * `--silent=false` does NOT work for this.
 * Both Beads must be OPEN. A closed Bead is dead scope, so the gate refuses it with
 * "bead is closed and is not dispatchable" — correct behaviour that reads as a broken
 * dispatch path if you reuse a probe Bead you closed after an earlier run. Mint fresh
 * ones rather than reopening old ones.
 *
 * The specialist must have a resolvable model. `explorer` has `execution.model: null`,
 * which is why SPECIALISTS_MCP_PROBE_MODEL is required rather than optional; without it
 * the dispatch is refused with `no_model_configured`.
