/**
 * Claude Code Channel push — the deterministic replacement for the `.21` poller
 * (unitAI-aiwva.21).
 *
 * Claude Code registers an inbound listener for `notifications/claude/channel`
 * when a connected MCP server declares `experimental: { 'claude/channel': {} }`.
 * The notification is unsolicited: it reaches a session that is idle, which no
 * tool result can do and which is the entire reason this module exists. The
 * host already emits every transition in-process, so nothing here polls, and
 * nothing here wakes the model except on a real event.
 *
 * Three properties decide the shape, and each is enforced rather than assumed:
 *
 *   - **The push is a REFERENCE, never the payload.** `content` names the
 *     activation and says to call `specialist_status`; the result, contract and
 *     transcript stay in the authority store. A channel frame is rendered
 *     straight into the session's context, so a body here is an unbounded
 *     context cost paid on an event the reader may not care about (spec AD/AA).
 *   - **Delivery is unacknowledged and gated eight ways.** Capability, protocol
 *     era, provider, feature flag, org policy, `--channels` membership,
 *     marketplace match and plugin allowlist — each failing gate is a SILENT
 *     no-op on the client. So this is delivery, never authority: the hook and
 *     `specialist_status` recovery paths stay exactly as they are.
 *   - **Only a legacy-era connection can carry it.** Claude Code refuses to
 *     register the listener when the connection negotiated 2026-07-28,
 *     reporting "connection negotiated a modern protocol revision with no
 *     unsolicited notification path". Stateless means no server-initiated
 *     frame. `serveStdio({ legacy: 'serve' })` is therefore a PRECONDITION for
 *     push, not a compatibility concession — see the era note in
 *     `docs/claude-native-integration-spec-2026-09-09.md`.
 *
 * Verified against the Claude Code 2.1.268 binary, not documentation: the gate
 * chain, the frame shape and the meta-key filter below are what that build
 * actually enforces.
