/**
 * MCP `specialist_resume` over `NativeActivationHost.resume` (Wave E4, Resume-only).
 *
 * Mirrors the Pi extension tool of the same name field-for-field: same params
 * (`activation_id`, `prompt`), same session continuity (id kept, attempt
 * advances), same unknown-activation error shape, same refusal-as-result rule.
 * The host is the SAME instance that dispatch/reply/stop use — resume adds no
 * authority and no second resolver. Refusals render through the shared
 * `renderRejection`, so reason strings stay byte-identical to every other
 * MCP refusal surface.
 *
 * Returns admission + view synchronously (`resultType: complete`); the new
 * attempt's validated result settles into the pusher exactly like a dispatch
 * result, so `specialist_status` projects it with no extra path.
