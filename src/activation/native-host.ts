/**
 * NativeActivationHost — hosts a real Specialist on an in-process Pi `AgentSession`.
 *
 * This is the shared runtime seam. The Pi extension and the Claude Code MCP server are
 * both frontends over this class; neither invokes the legacy `sp run` CLI, and a future
 * Chain scheduler can call `start()` with a synthetic request because nothing here depends
 * on TUI state.
 *
 * WRITERS ARE ADMITTED, and the lease is wired. This paragraph used to say the opposite and
 * was left behind when the wiring landed — the exact drift this epic kept finding elsewhere,
 * so it is worth being precise about what is and is not true now:
 *   - A `MEDIUM` or `HIGH` tier resolves to `access: 'write'` and MUST acquire the workspace
 *     lease before an AgentSession exists; a denied lease is a refusal, not a warning.
 *   - `admitToolCall` re-checks the lease on every mutating tool call, and `guarded-tools.ts`
 *     wraps pi's four mutating builtins so a refusal comes back as a tool RESULT.
 *   - `releaseIfWriter` releases on DISPOSAL and converts a throwing release into
 *     `lease_uncertain` evidence rather than a silent success. It does NOT release on
 *     settle, though `workspace-lease.ts`'s wiring note (call site 3) says it should — so a
 *     settled writer keeps its workspace until an explicit stop, and sequential writer
 *     handoff needs one. That divergence is `unitAI-rrdnt.59` and is a design decision
 *     rather than an oversight to patch: releasing on settle buys automatic handoff and
 *     costs guaranteed resumability.
 *   The lease guards the LLM TOOL PATH ONLY. `pi.exec` and `AgentSession.executeBash` do not
 *   fire the tool_call handler (`unitAI-rrdnt.6`, unclosed), so a child reaching the
 *   filesystem that way is not fenced. Do not describe writers as "fenced" without that
 *   qualifier.
 *   - No model picker.
 *
 * The interaction protocol and the Fleet DO exist: see `./interaction.ts`, `./ask-tool.ts`
 * and `./registry.ts`.
 *
 * Session lifetime deliberately exceeds turn lifetime: reaching `agent_settled` makes a
 * Specialist *waiting and resumable*, never disposed. Disposal is an explicit act.
