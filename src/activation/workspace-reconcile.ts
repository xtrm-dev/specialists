/**
 * Phase 9 — reconciliation of an uncertain workspace.
 *
 * `workspace-lease.ts` produces `uncertain` honestly and refuses to resolve it: `acquire`
 * will not steal an uncertain lease and `release` throws rather than guess. That is the
 * correct safety property and, on its own, a liveness bug — a writer killed mid-mutation
 * leaves a workspace that is not silently free and also permanently unusable. This module
 * is the only path out, and it exists so that the way out is a recorded decision rather
 * than an inference.
 *
 * ## The rule the obvious implementation gets wrong
 *
 * The tempting shape is `reconcile(workspace)` — look at the world, work out what happened,
 * free the lease if it looks safe. That is precisely the blind free the uncertain state
 * exists to prevent, wearing a different name: absence of a process is not evidence that a
 * mutation completed, and it is not evidence that it did not. So reconciliation here is a
 * PROPOSAL that the module validates and records:
 *
 *   1. the caller states the outcome it wants, who decided it, and on what durable basis;
 *   2. the module re-inspects the live lease at decision time;
 *   3. it refuses any outcome the current `uncertainReason` does not permit;
 *   4. it appends the attempt — accepted or refused — to a durable log beside the lease.
 *
 * A refusal is a result, not an error to discard. It leaves the workspace uncertain and
 * stays readable through `specialist_status`, because a workspace nobody can resolve is
 * exactly the thing an operator needs to see.
 *
 * ## Why the four uncertain reasons are not one rule
 *
 * They were separated in `inspect()` because they have different safe actions, and
 * collapsing them here would waste that. What each one licenses:
 *
 *   `holder_process_gone`     the recorded PID has no `/proc` entry. The holder is provably
 *                             not running, so an operator citing durable evidence may free
 *                             the workspace or record a successor.
 *   `holder_start_mismatch`   the PID runs but is a different process. The holder is equally
 *                             provably gone; the same outcomes are open. It is kept distinct
 *                             because the recorded PID now belongs to an unrelated process
 *                             and must never be treated as the holder for any purpose.
 *   `unreadable_record`       there is no holder identity at all. Nothing can be attributed
 *                             as safely finished, so `safe_free` is refused; an operator who
 *                             has inspected the worktree may still name a successor and free
 *                             it that way, which asserts ownership instead of completion.
 *   `liveness_unverifiable`   this host cannot see processes at all. No evidence available
 *                             to this runtime can show that the holder stopped, so every
 *                             resolving outcome is refused and only
 *                             `manual_attention_required` may be recorded.
 *
 * The last row is the bright line of this module, and it is the one a later reader will want
 * to relax. Every argument for relaxing it is an inference from absence wearing a threshold:
 * "the lease is very old", "nothing has touched the worktree in an hour", "give it a
 * timeout". None of those observe the holder. On a host that cannot see processes, an old
 * lease and a live writer produce identical evidence, which is exactly the condition
 * `uncertain` was invented to represent. A runtime that cannot verify does not act. Adding a
 * timeout here means deleting this paragraph first.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Acquisition and the `linkSync` publish are untouched. This module reads the lease record
 * and, for an accepted resolving outcome, removes it — it never goes through `release`,
 * which refuses an uncertain lease by design, and it never publishes a lease of its own.
 *
 * The `pi.exec`/`executeBash` veto hole (`unitAI-rrdnt.6`, H3/H4 in `workspace-lease.ts`)
 * is still open and reconciliation does not assume otherwise. It never claims to know what
 * a departed holder did; it only records what a decider asserts and on what basis.
