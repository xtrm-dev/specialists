// src/tools/specialist/activation.tool.ts
//
// The Claude Code MCP frontend over `NativeActivationHost` — PRD Phase 13.
//
// Claude Code could previously obtain a Specialist only by shelling out to `sp run` in a
// terminal or an `xt` session. The native runtime already existed in-process, so the
// coordinator best placed to use it was the one that could not. These tools close that
// gap, and they close it by CALLING the host, never by spawning `sp`: a subprocess
// that runs `sp` would satisfy the letter of "expose the runtime over MCP" and defeat its
// entire purpose. No child process is reachable from here at all: inline-contract
// creation is owned by `host.start()` through the work boundary (validate → create →
// attest → claim), never by a `bd` subprocess. The live evidence for acceptance AV
// asserts the absence of `sp` against the process table rather than against intent.
//
// The gates are not re-implemented here, and that is the load-bearing property. Bead
// readiness, the StepContract compilation, the capability contract, the model gate and
// (once Phase 10 lands) the workspace writer lease all live inside `host.start()`. A
// second dispatch path that re-checked them would drift; a second dispatch path that
// skipped them is how gates die. This module's whole job is argument marshalling and
// snapshot projection.
//
// Deliberately NOT here: any message vocabulary of its own. `specialist_reply` carries an
// `InteractionMessage` through `host.answer()` (PRD invariant BH) — MCP is a
// serialisation of that type, never a parallel protocol. Asynchronous push toward Claude
// is Phase 14 and is why `specialist_status` reports pending asks by projection: until
// the push channel exists, a coordinator learns about a question by reading, and a
// reader that cannot see the ask is a Specialist stuck forever.
//
// Phase 14 (unitAI-rrdnt.34) adds the push half WITHOUT removing that read half. The
// coordinator address is a property of the dispatch, not of the runtime — the server
// builds one host for its whole life and learns a coordinator session only per call — so
// the dispatch registers the route and the settled result with `RuntimeEventPusher`, and
// `specialist_status` projects the same recorded results. A coordinator that never
// received the push reads the identical object here; that is what makes the notification
// a projection rather than the authority.

 * already has its path (reply for an outstanding question, resume for a settled one,
 * steer/stop for a running one), and retry refuses those states with the right pointer
 * rather than becoming a second dispatch. An escalation or question that CAN wait stays
 * an ask answered with specialist_reply; retry is for runs that already died.
