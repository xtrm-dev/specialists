## Communication Style

Use controlled, precise, and direct language throughout the work session, including plans, progress updates, analysis, reviews, implementation notes, documentation, handoffs, and final reports. Prefer explicit subjects, active voice, consistent terminology, concrete statements, and logically ordered sentences. Keep the writing natural and concise. Avoid conversational filler, ornamental language, vague qualifiers, unnecessary jargon, and exaggerated certainty.

Adapt the level of rigor to the context. Use clear technical prose for analysis, architecture, debugging, design discussion, and collaboration. Use a stricter ASD-STE100-oriented style for procedures, commands, migrations, deployments, security requirements, destructive operations, rollback instructions, acceptance criteria, and operator handoffs. In these cases, state conditions before actions, identify the responsible actor, express one principal action per sentence, preserve the required sequence, and describe expected results and failure conditions explicitly.

Clearly distinguish verified facts, observations, assumptions, inferences, recommendations, and unresolved questions. Do not report an action as successful without evidence. Preserve exact names for repositories, services, contracts, routes, identifiers, configuration fields, and work items. Do not omit material ownership, dependencies, risks, preconditions, rollback requirements, or verification criteria for the sake of brevity.

## Task Tracking (two-tier)

Up to two task systems coexist in this repo. Where the runtime exposes both, use both; do not substitute one for the other. On a runtime with no task tools, beads alone is correct and complete — do not invent or call a native task API the runtime does not expose.

- **Beads (`bd`)** — top-level durable tracking, on every runtime. Authoritative for ownership, dependencies, cross-session memory, and closure. Read the rest of this file and use targeted lookup (`bd ready`, `bd search "<terms>"`, `bd show <id>`) before starting work; `bd prime` is an opt-in diagnostic, not a session-start step. File, claim, and close work here.
- **The runtime's own task system, when the runtime has one** — this-session execution tracking. Use it to mirror the active bead and break it into smaller intermediate steps. Ephemeral; does not replace beads. Names differ per runtime; read the runtime's own tool list rather than assuming a name.

Rule: on a runtime that exposes task tools, when you pick up a bead, create native tasks that track it — reference the bead ID in each task title (e.g. `N.N summary — status (worker %NNNN)`) — and add any smaller intermediate steps as native sub-tasks. Beads own the durable record; native tasks own the in-flight breakdown.

Example native task list mirroring beads:
- ◼ N.N smoke container global surface — BLOCKS RELEASE (worker %NNNN)
- ◼ N.N status test flake under load (worker %NNNN)
- ◻ Pre-release smoke run against current main branches
- ◻ Dispatch N.N stale doc metrics + N.N Claude inbox surface
- ◻ Dispatch N.N, N.N, N.N remaining small beads

# XTRM Agent Workflow

> Full reference: [XTRM-GUIDE.md](XTRM-GUIDE.md)
> Retrieve memory on demand (commit corpus first, targeted `bd memories` leads); `bd prime` is an opt-in diagnostic, never a session-start step. Full doctrine: `.xtrm/config/instructions/memory-doctrine.md`.

## Session Start

1. Targeted lookup (`bd ready`, `bd search`, `bd show`) — `bd prime` only as opt-in diagnostic
2. `bv --robot-triage` — graph-aware triage: ranked picks, unblock targets, project health
3. `bd update <id> --claim` — claim before any file edit

## Execution Interaction Policy

- Proceed by default on standard implementation tasks once scope is clear.
- Do **not** ask repetitive “Proceed? Yes/No” confirmations.
- Ask for confirmation only when actions are destructive, irreversible, or high-risk (e.g. `rm`, history rewrite, mass deletes, credential rotation, prod-impacting ops).
- Prefer concise clarifying questions only when requirements are genuinely ambiguous.

## Active Gates (extensions enforce these — not optional)

| Gate | Trigger | Required action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Edit** | Write/Edit without active claim | `bd update <id> --claim` |
| **Commit** | `git commit` while claim is open | `bd close <id>` first, then commit |
| **Stop** | Session end with unclosed claim | `bd close <id>` |
| **Dispatch** *(bridge — discipline only, not yet extension-enforced)* | Specialist run against a `contract:draft` bead | Promote first: explore + rewrite full 7-section contract + `bd set-state <id> contract=ready --reason "..."`. Check with `bd state <id> contract` before dispatch. |

## bd Command Reference

```bash
# Work discovery
bd ready                               # Unblocked open issues
bd show <id>                           # Full detail + deps + blockers
bd list --status=in_progress           # Your active claims
bd query "status=in_progress AND assignee=me"  # Complex filter
bd search <text>                       # Full-text search across issues

# Claiming & updating
bd update <id> --claim                 # Claim (sets you as owner, status→in_progress)
bd update <id> --append-notes "..."     # Append to existing notes
bd update <id> --notes "..."           # Replace notes (use --append-notes to append)
bd update <id> --status=blocked        # Mark blocked
bd update                              # Update last-touched issue (no ID needed)

# Creating
bd create --title="..." --description="..." --type=task --priority=2
# --parent <bead-id>                    nest as <id>.1, .2, … (recursive: .1.1) — default whenever this bead
#                                        services another bead's work, not only epics
# --labels contract:draft               capture-for-later: real PROBLEM + rough SCOPE, rest TBD — never dispatchable
#                                        until promoted (`bd set-state <id> contract=ready`); see using-specialists
# --deps "discovered-from:<parent-id>"  link follow-ups to source
# priority: 0=critical  1=high  2=medium  3=low  4=backlog
# types: task | bug | feature | epic | chore | decision

# Closing
bd close <id>                          # Close issue
bd close <id> --reason="Done: ..."     # Close with context
bd close <id1> <id2> <id3>            # Batch close

# Dependencies
bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>        # issue depends on depends-on (depends-on blocks issue)
bd dep <blocker> --blocks <blocked>    # shorthand: blocker blocks blocked
bd dep relate <a> <b>                  # non-blocking "relates to" link
bd dep tree <id>                       # visualise dependency tree
bd blocked                             # show all currently blocked issues

# Health & pre-flight
bd stats                               # Open/closed/blocked counts
bd preflight --check                   # Pre-PR readiness (lint, tests, beads)
bd doctor                              # Diagnose installation issues
```

## Git Workflow (strict: one branch per issue)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<issue-id>-<slug>   # or fix/... chore/...
bd update <id> --claim                       # claim before any edit
# ... write code ...
bd close <id> --reason="..."                 # closes issue
xt end                                       # push, PR, merge, worktree cleanup
```

**Never** continue new work on a previously used branch.

## Quality Gates (automatic)

Run on every file edit via PostToolUse extension:
- **TypeScript/JS**: ESLint + tsc
- **Python**: ruff + mypy

Gate output appears as extension context. Fix failures before proceeding — do not commit with lint errors.

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for the beads issue board. Use it instead of `bd ready` when you need ranked picks, dependency-aware scheduling, or project health signals.

> **CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

```bash
bv --robot-triage             # THE entry point — ranked picks, quick wins, blockers, health
bv --robot-next               # Single top pick + claim command (minimal output)
bv --robot-triage --format toon  # Token-optimized output for lower context usage
```

**Scope boundary:** bv = *what to work on*. `bd` = creating, claiming, closing issues.

### Planning & Analysis

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection |
| `--robot-insights` | Full graph metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified, cycles introduced/resolved |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend        # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan    # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track  # Group by parallel work streams
```

### Understanding Output

- `data_hash` — fingerprint of beads state (verify consistency across calls)
- Phase 1 (instant): degree, topo sort, density
- Phase 2 (async, 500ms): PageRank, betweenness, HITS, cycles — check `status` flags

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'              # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'     # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'               # Circular deps — must fix
```

## Worktree Sessions

- `xt pi` — launch Pi in a sandboxed worktree
- `xt end` — close session: commit / push / PR / cleanup

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **specialists** (16684 symbols, 39758 relationships, 813 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .`; report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "master" --repo .`.
- MUST warn on HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` pre-edit; never use `riskSharedAxes` to waive a HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` warning. Compare File/symbol: MCP File omits axes; Graph-RAG expands File.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- **MUST use `query({search_query: "concept"})` for concepts/flows, `context({name: "symbolName"})` for a named symbol, or `impact` for blast radius, on read-only callers, dependencies, imports, or execution flow.** Graph first; text search only for empty/`UNKNOWN`/literals.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

## Specialists (`sp` / `specialists`)

**At session start, run:**

```bash
sp help
```

`sp help` is canonical and always current. Do not rely on memorized command lists — the command surface changes between releases. `CLAUDE.md` contains project-specific specialist context but may drift; `sp help` never does.

Also explore subcommand surfaces before using them:

```bash
sp run --help
sp epic --help
sp edit --help
sp ps --help
```

**Key facts:**
- MCP exposes only `use_specialist` — use CLI (`sp run`, `sp feed`, `sp result`, `sp resume`, `sp steer`, `sp stop`, `sp edit`) for all orchestration (`sp steer` is the live mid-run control surface)
- Tracked work requires `--bead <id>`; `--prompt` is for untracked one-offs only
- Specialist configs live in `config/specialists/` (shipped) and `.specialists/user/` (overrides); use `sp edit` — not direct JSON edits — to change fields
- `sp edit --list-presets` shows available model presets for the current install
- `sp epic abandon <id> --reason "..."` closes stale epics; live members require `--force`. Listed in `sp epic --help`.
- `sp finalize <any-chain-job-id>` cascades — closes every waiting keep-alive member of a chain after reviewer PASS. Use this when auto-finalize misses (e.g. PASS delivered via `sp resume` instead of streaming output).
- Epic state is **derived live**, not driven by operator transitions. Only `merged` / `abandoned` are persisted-terminal. Persisted soft `failed` markers are recoverable: the next `sp epic merge` retries fresh.
