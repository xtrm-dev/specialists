### Added
- `changelog-keeper` specialist v1 for release-note synthesis from curated xt reports (unitAI-znkgi.2)
- Releasing skill workflow for prepare/publish release flow after CLI removal (unitAI-fhbf4)
- `sp doctor` / `sp status` version-check nudges with cached tag awareness and per-tag dedupe (unitAI-znkgi.9)

### Changed
- `sp release prepare` now accepts markdown-only specialist output, normalizes missing section keys, and keeps section replacement bounded (unitAI-8elrc; unitAI-1avsn; unitAI-a3s9a)
- `changelog-keeper` output tightened with fallback chain and stricter section fidelity for release drafts (unitAI-8elrc; unitAI-khlqj)
- `sp clean` migrated to DB-first job selection with PID-primary stale-process cleanup (`--processes`) (unitAI-ltwme)
- `sp script` stdout cap raised to 128MB with incremental parse for oversized streams (unitAI-9cygd; unitAI-a47ub)
- `sp script` retained cap handling fixed so overflow recovery stays stable under repeated reads (unitAI-1avsn; unitAI-a47ub)
- `sp script` template-check / compat guard fix for spec loading under release-related flows (unitAI-r7zte)
- `sp release` semver section label now derives from `--to HEAD` correctly (unitAI-7qu0t)
- `sp release` draft parser now accepts array-shape sections and markdown fallback (unitAI-a3s9a)
- Release parser now accepts JSON drafts missing section keys and backfills empty buckets (unitAI-1avsn)

- `docs/design/gzrx-tool-catalog.md` aligned with source policy for centralized tool catalog design (unitAI-gzrx)
- `src/cli/doctor.ts` drift check now warns on stale user-overlay specialists before they shadow defaults (unitAI-bb3h6)

- `src/cli/release.ts` / `src/cli/version-check.ts` / `src/cli/clean.ts` got the release, version-check, and DB-first cleanup flow updates (unitAI-znkgi.3; unitAI-znkgi.9; unitAI-ltwme)
- `docs/observability-metrics.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`, and skill mirrors updated for KPI and release workflow drift (unitAI-drs41.4; unitAI-znkgi.5)

### Fixed
- Release draft rendering now handles markdown-only output and JSON drafts missing section keys without losing bullets (unitAI-8elrc; unitAI-1avsn)
- `sp script` overflow handling now preserves retained caps across parse retries and large stdout bursts (unitAI-a47ub)
- `sp release` publish/prepare validation now rejects section-label and array-shape edge cases before bad tags land (unitAI-7qu0t; unitAI-a3s9a)
- `sp clean` no longer depends on file-era job dirs and survives deleted process state (unitAI-ltwme)

### Removed
- `sp release` CLI path replaced by releasing skill workflow for publishing releases (unitAI-fhbf4)

## [3.8.0] - 2026-04-26

`specialists-service` v1 — HTTP and CLI surfaces for script-class specialists, plus a strict 1:1 schema cut so every JSON field maps to a runtime consumer.

### Added
- **`sp serve`**: Node `http` server exposing `POST /v1/generate` and `GET /healthz` for script-class specialists; real semaphore queue with HTTP 429 on contention, SIGTERM forwarding to in-flight pi children, 4MB stdout cap, trace rows persisted to canonical `observability.db` with `surface: 'script_specialist'` (unitAI-c6uvn).
- **`sp script <name>`**: One-shot CLI peer to `sp serve` for cron and host scripts; cron-friendly exit codes (0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/75); `--single-instance <lockpath>` uses `flock` with `EX_TEMPFAIL` on contention (unitAI-6qctn).
- **`sp validate <path> --target script`**: Offline pre-deploy validator that runs schema parse plus `compatGuard` and exits non-zero on failure with structured error (unitAI-bahj1).
- **Docker image**: Multi-stage `oven/bun` build, non-root UID 10001 user, `WORKDIR /work`, `ARG PI_VERSION=latest`. Sidecar template at `docker/compose.example.yml` (unitAI-atwom).
- **CI canary `.github/workflows/pi-compat.yml`**: Weekly cron + PR-triggered smoke that fails loud on pi spawn-flag drift; no quota, no secrets, no LLM calls (unitAI-nsru6).
- **Reference Python adapter `docs/examples/specialists_client.py`**: Stdlib-only, mirrors the closed `error_type` union with a `TRANSPORT` value for caller-side HTTP failures; live-smoked end-to-end against real pi (unitAI-s2won).
- **Reference script-class spec `docs/examples/mercury-atomic-summarizer.specialist.json`**: Phase 1 first-spec, copyable, validated against the migration doc's schema target (unitAI-t9t11).
- **Reference smoke spec `docs/examples/smoke-echo.specialist.json`**: For verifying a fresh deployment.
- **`handoff-feedor.md`**: One-page operator handoff at repo root for adopting `specialists-service` v1 in darth-feedor.
- **Documentation**: `docs/specialists-service.md` (canonical contract), `docs/specialists-service-install.md` (build-from-repo install with rootless-podman + Fedora-SELinux notes), `docs/specialists-service-evaluation.md` (production-evaluation memo), `docs/release-image.md` (maintainer build/push reference), `Script-class authoring` section in `docs/authoring.md`, `Schema target` translation table in `docs/darth-feedor-migration.md`.
- **Spec uniformity audit script `config/skills/specialists-creator/scripts/audit-spec-uniformity.mjs`**: Portable, reports parse failures and unknown keys; KNOWN sets stay in lockstep with `src/specialist/schema.ts`.

### Changed
- **Zod schema passthrough**: `SpecialistSchema` now uses `.passthrough()` on every nested object so unknown keys survive `parseSpecialist()` and `sp edit` round-trip stops silently dropping fields (unitAI-xutg2).
- **Strict 1:1 schema-to-runtime cut**: Every JSON field must map to a runtime consumer (unitAI-8n0aa). Dropped `CommunicationSchema` entirely (`next_specialists`, `publishes`), `capabilities.diagnostic_scripts`, `prompt.normalize_template`, `prompt.examples`, `execution.preferred_profile`, `execution.approval_mode`, `metadata.author`, `metadata.created`, root `heartbeat`, and the deprecated `ScriptEntry.path` alias. 26 specs, `docs/authoring.md`, `config/skills/specialists-creator/SKILL.md`, `src/cli/view.ts`, and `scaffold-specialist.ts` updated in lockstep.
- **`--user-dir` → `--project-dir`**: Flag renamed in `sp script` and `sp serve` (the flag has always been the project root, not a user-spec dir); `--user-dir` retained as a deprecated alias (unitAI-rfjbd).
- **Pi 0.70.x compatibility**: Dropped the `args.push('--', prompt)` option terminator in `src/specialist/script-runner.ts`; both 0.64 and 0.70.2 accept positional prompt. Image base unpinned to `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@latest` (unitAI-w0h7z).
- **`xt-merge` output_to → output_file**: Migrated to canonical top-level field — a typo'd dead alias had been silently dropping `merge-prs-result.md` writes since the spec was authored (unitAI-yb9qu).
- **README documentation map**: Now points to the new specialists-service docs.

### Fixed
- **NDJSON parser real shape handling**: Now handles pi's real `message_end` and `agent_end` event shapes; prior parser matched a fictional shape that the test mock perpetuated, returning empty assistant text in production (unitAI-68owr).
- **Pi `errorMessage` surfacing**: When content is empty, `message.errorMessage` is surfaced through the error taxonomy so quota and auth errors no longer silently return `success: true` with empty output (unitAI-68owr).
- **JSON-mode markdown fence stripping**: `stripMarkdownFences()` runs before `JSON.parse` for `response_format=json` responses; some models (e.g. kimi) wrap JSON in markdown code fences regardless of the format directive (unitAI-68owr).
- **`specialists-creator.specialist.json` JSON corruption**: A zsh prompt artifact had been pasted into the file as a JSON key (`"permission_requiredspecialists — zsh "`); only caught after `.passthrough()` exposed the silent survival of unknown keys (unitAI-826wl).
- **Stale skill-path sweep**: Bulk-swept 19 stale `.xtrm/skills/active/pi/<name>/` skill paths across canonical and mirror specs; the `pi/` subdirectory was removed in a prior layout migration but the references were never updated (unitAI-826wl).

### Removed
- **`parallel-review` specialist files**: Removed from canonical and mirror (renamed to `parallel-runner` in 3.4.0; spec files lingered until this cleanup).
- **11 declarative-only schema fields**: See Changed → strict 1:1 schema cut. None had a runtime consumer.
