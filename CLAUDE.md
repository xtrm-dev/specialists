# XTRM Agent Workflow

> Full reference: [XTRM-GUIDE.md](XTRM-GUIDE.md) | Session manual: `/using-xtrm` skill
> Run `bd prime` at session start (or after `/compact`) for live beads workflow context.

## Session Start

1. `bd prime` — load workflow context and active claims
2. `bd memories <keyword>` — retrieve memories relevant to today's task
3. `bd recall <key>` — retrieve a specific memory by key if needed
4. `bv --robot-triage` — graph-aware triage: ranked picks, unblock targets, project health
5. `bd update <id> --claim` — claim before any file edit

## Execution Interaction Policy

- Proceed by default on standard implementation tasks once scope is clear.
- Do **not** ask repetitive “Proceed? Yes/No” confirmations.
- Ask for confirmation only when actions are destructive, irreversible, or high-risk (e.g. `rm`, history rewrite, mass deletes, credential rotation, prod-impacting ops).
- Prefer concise clarifying questions only when requirements are genuinely ambiguous.

## Active Gates (hooks enforce these — not optional)

| Gate | Trigger | Required action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Edit** | Write/Edit without active claim | `bd update <id> --claim` |
| **Commit** | `git commit` while claim is open | `bd close <id>` first, then commit |
| **Stop** | Session end with unclosed claim | `bd close <id>` |
| **Memory** | `bd close <id>` without issue ack | First run `bd remember "<insight>"` (or decide nothing novel), then `bd kv set "memory-acked:<id>" "saved:<key>"` or `"nothing novel:<reason>"`, then retry `bd close <id> --reason="..."` (Stop hook remains fallback reminder) |

## bd Command Reference

```bash
# Work discovery
bd ready                               # Unblocked open issues
bd show <id>                           # Full detail + deps + blockers
bd list --status=in_progress           # Your active claims
bd query "status=in_progress AND assignee=me"  # Complex filter
bd search <text>                       # Full-text search across issues

# Claiming & updating
bd update <id> --claim                 # Claim (sets you as owner, status→in_progress)
bd update <id> --notes "..."           # Append notes inline
bd update <id> --status=blocked        # Mark blocked
bd update                              # Update last-touched issue (no ID needed)

# Creating
bd create --title="..." --description="..." --type=task --priority=2
# --deps "discovered-from:<parent-id>"  link follow-ups to source
# priority: 0=critical  1=high  2=medium  3=low  4=backlog
# types: task | bug | feature | epic | chore | decision

# Closing
# Memory gate: ack per issue before close
#   bd kv set "memory-acked:<id>" "saved:<key>"  OR  "nothing novel:<reason>"
bd close <id>                          # Close issue (blocked until memory-acked:<id> exists)
bd close <id> --reason="Done: ..."     # Close with context
bd close <id1> <id2> <id3>            # Batch close (each id needs its own memory ack)

# Dependencies
bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>        # issue depends on depends-on (depends-on blocks issue)
bd dep <blocker> --blocks <blocked>    # shorthand: blocker blocks blocked
bd dep relate <a> <b>                  # non-blocking "relates to" link
bd dep tree <id>                       # visualise dependency tree
bd blocked                             # show all currently blocked issues

# Persistent memory
bd remember "<insight>"                # Store across sessions (project-scoped)
bd memories <keyword>                  # Search stored memories
bd recall <key>                        # Retrieve full memory by key
bd forget <key>                        # Remove a memory

# Health & pre-flight
bd stats                               # Open/closed/blocked counts
bd preflight --check                   # Pre-PR readiness (lint, tests, beads)
bd doctor                              # Diagnose installation issues
```

## Git Workflow (strict: one branch per issue)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<issue-id>-<slug>   # or fix/... chore/...
bd update <id> --claim                       # claim before any edit
# ... write code ...
bd close <id> --reason="..."                 # closes issue
xt end                                       # push, PR, merge, worktree cleanup
```

**Never** continue new work on a previously used branch.

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for the beads issue board. Use it instead of `bd ready` when you need ranked picks, dependency-aware scheduling, or project health signals.

> **CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

```bash
bv --robot-triage             # THE entry point — ranked picks, quick wins, blockers, health
bv --robot-next               # Single top pick + claim command (minimal output)
bv --robot-triage --format toon  # Token-optimized output for lower context usage
```

**Scope boundary:** bv = *what to work on*. `bd` = creating, claiming, closing issues.

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection |
| `--robot-insights` | PageRank, betweenness, HITS, cycles, critical path |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified |

```bash
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan    # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track  # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'   # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'    # Circular deps — must fix
```

## Code Intelligence (mandatory before edits)

Use **Serena** (`using-serena-lsp` skill) for all code reads and edits:
- `find_symbol` → `get_symbols_overview` → `replace_symbol_body`
- Never grep-read-sed when symbolic tools are available

Use **GitNexus** MCP tools before touching any symbol:
- `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` — blast radius
- `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})` — callers, callees, execution flows
- `gitnexus_detect_changes()` — verify scope before every commit
- `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` — explore unfamiliar areas

Stop and warn the user if impact returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk.

## Quality Gates (automatic)

Run on every file edit via PostToolUse hooks:
- **TypeScript/JS**: ESLint + tsc
- **Python**: ruff + mypy

Gate output appears as hook context. Fix failures before proceeding — do not commit with lint errors.

## Worktree Sessions

- `xt claude` — launch Claude Code in a sandboxed worktree
- `xt end` — close session: commit / push / PR / cleanup
<!-- xtrm:end -->

# Project: specialists

> Skills are loaded on demand — don't duplicate skill content here.
> If a section grows past 30 lines, it probably belongs in a skill.

## Session start

```bash
bd prime                        # workflow context + active claims
bv --robot-triage --format toon # ranked work + project health
bd update <id> --claim          # claim before any file edit
```

`bv` ONLY with `--robot-*` flags — bare `bv` opens a TUI and blocks the session.

## Active gates (hooks enforce — not optional)

| Gate | Trigger | Required action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Edit | Write/Edit without active claim | `bd update <id> --claim` |
| Commit | `git commit` while claim is open | `bd close <id>` first |
| Memory | `bd close <id>` without ack | `bd remember "..."` then `bd kv set "memory-acked:<id>" "saved:<key>"` (or `"nothing novel:<reason>"`) then close |
| Stop | Session end with unclosed claim | `bd close <id>` |

## Execution policy

- Proceed by default once scope is clear. No repetitive "Proceed? Yes/No" prompts.
- Confirm only for destructive/irreversible/high-risk actions (rm, history rewrite, mass deletes, credential rotation, prod ops).
- Ask only when requirements are genuinely ambiguous.

## Branching

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<issue-id>-<slug>   # fix/... chore/... etc.
# work, close bead, commit
xt end                                      # push + PR + merge + worktree cleanup
```

Never continue new work on a previously used branch.

## Code intelligence (mandatory before edits)

Before modifying any function/class/method:
- `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` — blast radius
- `gitnexus_context({name: "X"})` — callers/callees/flows
- `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before commit

Use Serena symbolic tools (`find_symbol` → `replace_symbol_body`) instead of grep-read-sed when available. Stop and warn if impact returns HIGH/CRITICAL.

## Quality gates (automatic on edit)

| Language | Tools |
|---|---|
| TS/JS | ESLint + tsc |
| Python | ruff + mypy |

Hook output appears as context. Fix failures before committing.

Run `bd memories <keyword>` or `bd recall <key>` for prior insights before substantial work.

## Specialist orchestration in one paragraph

`--bead` is the prompt — don't run a specialist until the bead is a usable task contract (PROBLEM / SUCCESS / SCOPE / NON_GOALS / CONSTRAINTS / VALIDATION / OUTPUT). Edit-capable specialists auto-provision a worktree from `--bead`. Reviewer reuses the executor workspace via `--job <exec-job>` — `--worktree` and `--job` are mutually exclusive. Keep executor/debugger jobs alive with `--keep-alive` so they're resumable. Default `--context-depth` is 3. Merge via `sp merge <chain-root>` or `sp epic merge <epic>` — never manual `git merge` for specialist branches. Per-turn output auto-appends to bead notes; `bd show <id>` is the canonical way to read a handoff. Full reference: `/using-specialists-v2`.

## Common gotchas (project-specific)

- **`sp stop` cleans `status.json`; `sp merge` then can't resolve the chain.** For doc-only chains, fall back to manual `git merge --no-ff` (skips tsc + conflict gates).
- **`--worktree` and `--job` are mutually exclusive.** First executor: `--worktree`. Reviewer/fix: `--job <exec-job>`.
- **Stale-base guard** blocks worktree dispatch if sibling epic chains have unmerged substantive commits. Override with `--force-stale-base` only with cause.
- **Manual `git merge` of feature branches breaks sp's epic bookkeeping.** Use `sp merge` / `sp epic merge` when possible.
- **GitNexus index goes stale on commit.** PostToolUse hook normally re-indexes after `git commit`/`git merge`; if not, `npx gitnexus analyze` (add `--embeddings` only if `.gitnexus/meta.json` shows `stats.embeddings > 0`).
- **`bd close` itself does not block.** Stop hook blocks only after a successful `bd close` in same session, and only when hook can resolve issue id from `claimed:<sessionId>`, `closed-this-session:<sessionId>`, or branch name. If `bd show` fails, gate fails open. Each id in batch needs its own ack before session stop.
- **Specialists are JSON** (`config/specialists/<name>.specialist.json`) — YAML is a deprecated legacy fallback (`loader.ts:101 deprecatedYaml`).

## Project-specific

- gzrx manifest system: see `docs/design/gzrx-tool-catalog.md` (canonical), `docs/design/gzrx-completion-critique.md` (gap analysis), bead `unitAI-qujxo` (completion epic).
- Specialists project guide / runtime architecture / key files: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`, `docs/features.md`.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **specialists** (4835 symbols, 10437 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/specialists/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/specialists/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/specialists/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/specialists/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/specialists/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
