/**
 * Mutating tools that consult the workspace lease before they run — PRD §52,
 * unitAI-rrdnt.36.2.
 *
 * The lease was wired at admission and release (unitAI-rrdnt.36.1) and that half works:
 * two activations cannot both hold one worktree, because the second is refused before a
 * session exists. What was missing is the block DURING a turn. `admitToolCall` existed,
 * was correct, emitted `tool_blocked`, failed closed on an unknown activation — and had no
 * caller. A guard nothing calls is not a guard.
 *
 * The obvious fix is to make each frontend call it. That is the wrong shape: it makes
 * enforcement optional, and the next frontend forgets without anything going red. Here the
 * host constructs the mutating builtins itself and wraps their `execute`, so the only
 * mutating tool the child can reach IS the guarded one. A frontend that wires nothing
 * cannot produce an unguarded activation, because the frontend is not involved.
 *
 * NOT `setActiveToolsByName`: within a turn the agent loop runs against a tool snapshot
 * taken at turn start, so revoking a tool cannot cancel a call that is already planned.
 * Every handler in a batch fires before any execution, which is why a per-call verdict is
 * enforceable where a tool-set change is not.
 *
 * KNOWN HOLE, unclosed and not closable on pi 0.85.1: this covers the LLM tool path only.
 * `AgentSession.executeBash()` and `pi.exec()` never route through a tool at all, so an
 * extension mutating through those bypasses this entirely (unitAI-rrdnt.6).
