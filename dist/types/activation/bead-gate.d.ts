/**
 * Bead readiness gate for native Specialist activation — PRD Phase 3.
 *
 * `--bead` is the prompt. A Specialist dispatched against a Bead that is only a title and
 * a sentence has nothing to work from, so it invents the missing scope; that is how
 * durable work silently loses its boundaries. The seven sections are not paperwork, they
 * are the task contract, and a Bead without them is not dispatchable.
 *
 * Before this module the discipline existed only in CLAUDE.md and hooks — nothing in
 * `src/` mentioned PROBLEM, NON_GOALS or SCRUTINY. The gate moves it into the admission
 * path, where a refusal is cheap and reversible, rather than leaving it to be discovered
 * by a child that already spent a model turn guessing.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: the contract's *quality*. The gate proves a section exists and is
 * non-empty. Whether SCOPE is a good scope is a judgement no parser makes, and pretending
 * otherwise would trade a useful gate for a bureaucratic one.
