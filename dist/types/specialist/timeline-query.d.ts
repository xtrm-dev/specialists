/**
 * Timeline Query Primitives for Feed v2
 *
 * Read and merge timeline events across multiple jobs while keeping the flat-file
 * hot path architecture intact.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * - Each job stores events in `.specialists/jobs/<id>/events.jsonl`
 * - This module reads those files and provides query/merge operations
 * - No database — direct file reads with efficient streaming
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { readJobEvents, mergeTimelineEvents } from './timeline-query.js';
 *
 * // Read events from a single job
 * const events = readJobEvents('.specialists/jobs/abc123');
 *
 * // Merge events from multiple jobs chronologically
 * const merged = mergeTimelineEvents([
 *   { jobId: 'abc123', specialist: 'code-review', events: events1 },
 *   { jobId: 'def456', specialist: 'bug-hunt', events: events2 },
 * ]);
 * ```
