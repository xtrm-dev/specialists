// Substrate plugin idle-wake watcher (asyncRewake, operator spec §Z/§AA/§AF).
//
// RECOVERY PATH, NOT THE PRIMARY WAKE. Since unitAI-aiwva.21 the primary wake is a
// Claude Code Channel push (`src/mcp/channel.ts`): the MCP server sends
// `notifications/claude/channel` the instant the host emits a transition, which reaches
// an idle session with no polling and no model wakeup until a real event exists.
//
// This watcher stays because that push is gated EIGHT ways on the client — capability,
// protocol era, provider, feature flag, org policy, `--channels` membership, marketplace
// match, plugin allowlist — and every failing gate is a SILENT no-op. It is also
// interactive-only: Claude Code registers the channel listener in the TUI, so any session
// where a gate is closed has no push path at all and this hook is the only thing that
// reaches it. Delivery is unacknowledged, so a push that vanishes leaves no trace either.
//
// Cadence is therefore relaxed rather than tuned: this is the slow safety net behind a
// fast path, and paying a 5s poll for an event the channel usually already delivered is
// the exact cost the channel work removed.
//
// Claude Code's own schema: "If true, hook runs in background and wakes the model on exit
// code 2 (blocking error). Implies async." So this process blocks in the background and the
// ONLY way it wakes the session is exiting 2.
//
// What it watches: activations in the Substrate store crossing into a state the coordinator
// must act on — `settled` (a result is readable) or `needs_reply` (a question is waiting).
// A baseline is taken at start so a session is woken for NEW events, never for the backlog
// that was already there when it began.
//
// What it emits: a REFERENCE, never authority — activation_id, state, reason. No result
// bodies, no prompt bodies, no forensic IDs, no instructions. The woken session reads
// authoritative state through specialist_status, exactly as a polling coordinator does.
// A wake that is missed degrades to polling: the coordinator reads the same object late,
// never a different object.
//
// Discipline: exit 0 on every failure path. Exit 2 ONLY on a real observed transition —
// a spurious 2 wakes a session for nothing, which trains the operator to ignore wakes.
